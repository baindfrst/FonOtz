Chapter 1 1.1 INTRODUCTION

Introduction

The New Zealand coast is 18 200 km in length (Rouse et al, 2003) and due to New Zealanders' love of the ocean (Stewart et al, 2005), and the fact that a large percentage of the New Zealand population lives close to the coast (Rouse et al, 2003), there are high numbers of people at any one time located within the coastal area. Hence, New Zealanders are vulnerable to coastal hazards. Hazards such as coastal erosion, flooding, storms/cyclones, and tsunami can all have damaging effects on life and property within the coastal zone. The impact a coastal hazard may have on a community is dependant upon the community's proximity to the coastal zone and, because the world's coastal areas are more heavily populated than inland areas (Small et al, 2000), coastal hazards can have a devastating effect on a number of communities.

The Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004 led many New Zealanders to become more aware of the devastating affects that a tsunami can have on coastal communities (Webb, 2005), and highlighted the need for people living in the coastal zone to be prepared for natural hazard events.

This research looks at community understanding of and preparedness for tsunami hazard in the eastern North Island, New Zealand. In order to achieve this, it is important to consider the following questions: · · · · ·

Does the public have sufficient knowledge of tsunami hazards in their community? Is there adequate information on tsunamis available to the public? Does the public have an understanding of tsunami warnings - both natural warnings and human generated warning systems? Is the public aware of the correct actions to take in the event of a tsunami warning being issued? How prepared are staff in hotels/motels for dealing with natural hazards in the Hawke's Bay tourism sector?

Chapter 1 1.2 RESEARCH AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

Introduction

The principal aim of this investigation was to analyse community understanding of and preparedness for tsunami hazard. This was established by:

1) Surveying visitor understanding of tsunami hazards and warning systems at selected camping grounds along the Hawke's Bay coastline.

2) Surveying staff in hotels/motels on their preparedness for managing natural hazard events in the Hawke's Bay tourism sector.

3) Comparing community understanding of tsunami hazards and warning systems before and after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami by resurveying Hawke's Bay and Gisborne residents who participated in the 2003 National Coastal survey.

1.3

STUDY AREA

Hawke's Bay and Gisborne, on the east coast of the North Island, New Zealand were the focus areas for this research. The east coast of New Zealand is at high risk from both local and distantly generated tsunami (Berryman, 2005), and Gisborne and Napier/Hastings have been identified among the most at risk areas in the country (Berryman, 2005).

1.3.1

Hawke's Bay

Hawke's Bay is located on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. The city of Napier is the main city of the Hawke's Bay region and at the time of the 2001 census the usual resident population count for Napier city totaled 53,661 (Statistics New Zealand, 2006).

The Hawke's Bay coastline stretches from approximately 5km north of Mahanga beach in northern Hawke's Bay through to approximately 13km south of Porangahau in southern Hawke's Bay, totaling 350km in length (Stevens and Robertson, 2005).

Due to its setting in one of New Zealand's most earthquake prone zones, Hawke's Bay is subjected to a high incidence of earthquakes, and the area is at high risk from both local tsunami, which have been generated from earthquakes associated with the Hikurangi Trench, and from distant source tsunami that have been generated from earthquakes off the coast of South America (Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, 2005). Between 1840 and 1982 a total of 5 significant tsunamis (>1m) were recorded in Hawke's Bay (de Lange and Healy, 3

Chapter 1

Introduction

1986). The largest tsunami to affect this region was a 15m tsunami which occurred on 3 February 1931. This was a locally generated tsunami caused by a rotational slump into the Waikari estuary in Northern Hawke's Bay which occurred following the Napier earthquake of 3 February 1931 (de Lange and Healy, 1986). The most damaging tsunami to affect Hawke's Bay in recent times was the tsunami of 22 May 1960. This was a distant source tsunami generated by an earthquake off the coast of South America. It caused considerable damage at Ahuriri and Te Awanga. At Ahuriri a footbridge over the Ahuriri Channel had a 40m gap torn into it and a gas main was damaged in the process. Approximately 17 000m3 of sand was scoured from the boat harbour. At the Te Awanga camping ground people were swept from their tents and elsewhere in Te Awanga dinghies were swept inland by the waves (de Lange and Healy, 1986; Johnston et al, submitted).

Hawke's Bay is a year-round holiday destination popular for its high sunshine hours, the Art Deco architecture, and activities based around the many vineyards and wineries in the region. Visitors to an area often have a significantly lower understanding of tsunami hazard compared with local residents (Johnston et al, 2005). This lack of knowledge increases the vulnerability of these people and reinforces the need to educate the general population about tsunami warnings, and how to prepare for, and cope with the effects of a tsunami in Hawke's Bay.

1.3.2

Gisborne

Gisborne is located to the north of Hawke's Bay. In 2001 the usual resident population count for the Gisborne district totaled 43,971 (Statistics New Zealand, 2006) and at this time the Gisborne urban area accounted for 72.1 percent of the entire Gisborne regions population (McDonald and Patterson, 2003). The Gisborne coastline is approximately 712 kilometres in length (Gisborne District Council, 2006) and the location of the Gisborne coast to the west of the Hikurangi subduction zone means that it is at risk from locally generated tsunami. As well as the risk from locally generated tsunami, Gisborne is also at risk from distant tsunami that may occur following an earthquake, volcanic eruption or landslide in other areas of the Pacific Ocean. Since the 1830s the Gisborne region has been impacted on by a total of 11 tsunamis (>1m), 3 of which have been locally generated and 8 which have been distantly generated (Berryman, 2005). In March 4

Chapter 1

Introduction

and May of 1947 two separate local tsunamis occurred near Gisborne following earthquakes off the east coast of the North Island causing waves up to 10m (Eiby, 1982a). The Gisborne region has been identified as likely to have the highest number of deaths for a 500 year return period tsunami of any area in New Zealand (Berryman, 2005). This makes it vital that the public understand tsunami warnings and know the correct actions to take in the event of a possible local source, or distant source tsunami.

1.4

STUDY APPROACH

This research is broken into three separate studies in order to achieve the objectives outlined above. Chapter 2 gives some background information and presents information on tsunami sources, tsunami in New Zealand, information on hazard vulnerability and people's preparedness for dealing with natural hazards, as well as information on tsunami warnings and evacuation in New Zealand. The camping ground visitor surveys have been presented in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 presents the tourism survey, which looks into the Napier tourism sector's preparedness for managing natural hazard events, and also discusses comparisons between a study conducted in Ocean Shores, Washington State, USA during 2005, and the findings of the 2006 Napier tourism survey. The findings of the 2006 National Coastal survey and a comparison between the 2003 National Coastal survey and the 2006 survey are presented in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 summarises the findings of the three studies in relation to community understanding of, and preparedness for tsunami risk in the eastern North Island, New Zealand, and makes some recommendations.

Background Information

Chapter Two BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Chapter 2 2.1 INTRODUCTION

Background Information

In 2003, a national survey of people living in and visiting coastal communities around New Zealand was conducted in order to determine people's awareness and perceptions of natural hazards, and their preparedness to deal with them (Johnston et al, 2003). This survey had a special focus on coastal erosion and tsunami. Following the devastating Indian Ocean Tsunami on 26 December 2004, tsunami have received considerable attention in New Zealand and in December 2005 two reports were released by the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management; providing information on New Zealand's risk from tsunami hazard and the preparedness of New Zealanders to deal with these often devastating events (Berryman, 2005; Webb, 2005).

This chapter presents a general overview of the two reports, information on tsunami sources, tsunami in New Zealand, some background information on hazard vulnerability and people's preparedness for dealing with natural hazards, tsunami warnings and evacuation.

2.2

THE TSUNAMI REPORTS

In January 2005 the New Zealand Government requested more information on New Zealand's risk from tsunami and the preparedness of New Zealanders to deal with such a hazard (Berryman, 2005). The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management (MCDEM) commissioned the Institute of Geological & Nuclear Sciences (GNS) to provide two reports. The first report known as the Science Report summarizes the current state of knowledge of tsunami in New Zealand and uses that knowledge to assess the varying levels of risk at both a national and a regional level (Berryman, 2005). The second report, known as the Preparedness Report looks at the current tsunami warning arrangements in New Zealand at both national and regional levels, compares these arrangements with the levels of risk derived from the Science Report, and makes recommendations for improving the management of tsunami risk at both a national and a regional level (Webb, 2005). The preparedness report by Berryman (2005) estimated that Gisborne will have the highest number of deaths for 6

Chapter 2

Background Information

a 500-year return period tsunami event out of 10 centres (Gisborne, Napier/Hastings, Christchurch, Wellington region, Dunedin, Auckland region, Whakatane, Tauranga, Timaru, and Nelson). Gisborne is closely followed by Napier/Hastings, Christchurch, and the Wellington region. These results can be viewed in table 2.1.

Table 2.1: Ranking of losses (mortality) and tsunami sources for a 500 year return period (10% probability in 50 years). (Source: Berryman, 2005).

It is important to note that these values assume that no warning has been issued of the impending tsunami, and are based on night-time population data (Berryman, 2005). This high risk indicates that it is important for people located in coastal communities around New Zealand to be aware of, and to be educated about the tsunami risk in their area in order to adequately prepare for a tsunami. 2.3 TSUNAMI

Tsunami is the Japanese word for harbour wave or waves (Dudley and Lee, 1988; Alexander, 1993; Bryant, 2001). A tsunami is a long period gravity wave (Ridgeway, 1984; de Lange and Healy, 2001), which occurs when a large volume of water is rapidly displaced. Tsunamis are generated from disturbances of the ocean floor (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, 1987; Hume et al, 1992; de Lange, 1998) which cause the entire water column from the sea bed to the ocean surface to be affected (Berryman, 2005). The main sources of tsunami generation are large submarine or coastal earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, submarine landslides, 7

Chapter 2

Background Information

landslides from adjoining cliffs, and meteor impact (Bryant, 2001; Berryman, 2005). The initial disturbance of the sea floor can create a series of waves which radiate outwards until the waves either collide with the coast or are dissipated (Ridgeway, 1984; Berryman, 2005). A tsunami behaves as a shallow water wave in all water depths and has a deep water wave height, a period and a wave length (Bryant, 2005). Tsunamis have a wave period between 6-60 minutes (de Lange, 2003). As the water depth that the wave is traveling in decreases, the wavelength also decreases and the height of the wave increases (de Lange, 2003). This increase in wave height occurs because as the wave travels into shallower water depths the energy in the wave is being concentrated into a smaller volume of water (Ridgeway, 1984). Tsunamis have a maximum wave height of < 0.5m in the deep ocean, but this can increase to > 30m as the wave enters shallow water (de Lange, 2003).

2.3.1

Tsunami sources

Tsunamis can be categorized as distant, regional, or local source. Berryman (2005) defines a distant source tsunami as a tsunami that is generated more than 3 hrs travel time from New Zealand, a regional source tsunami as a tsunami that has a travel time between 1 and 3 hours from New Zealand, and a local source tsunami as a tsunami that originated between 0-60 minutes travel time from the New Zealand coast.

Tsunamis reaching the New Zealand coast from distant sources have generally traveled from areas in the Pacific Ocean such as off the west coast of South America, or less frequently from the Tonga-Kermadec region (Eiby, 1982b). Regional source tsunami originate from earthquakes or volcanoes in the tectonically active regions north of New Zealand (e.g. Vanuatu, Tonga, and the Kermadec Islands), and from areas to the south of New Zealand between 50-60°S (Berryman, 2005). Local source tsunamis are the most common tsunami to impact on the New Zealand coast (de Lange and Healy, 1986). Most local tsunami events in New Zealand have been associated with earthquakes (de Lange and Healy, 1986). A number of locally generated tsunamis have occurred along the New Zealand coast in the past with the most well-observed local source tsunamis in New Zealand occurring near Gisborne during March and May 1947 (Eiby, 1982b). The highest tsunami waves to reach the New Zealand coast have all been generated from local sources (de Lange and Healy, 8

Chapter 2

Background Information

1986) which increases the risk to coastal communities around New Zealand because to date there are no warning systems in place in New Zealand for locally generated tsunami.

2.3.2

Historical Tsunami in New Zealand

Historically New Zealand has been impacted on by a number of tsunami. De Lange and Healy (1986) identified 32 tsunami events which impacted on the New Zealand coast between 1840 and 1982, however this has since been updated to 44 between the 1820's and May 2006 (Unpublished GNS Tsunami database, 2006), and Goff and Chagué-Goff (2001) discuss evidence of a number of paleotsunami events dating back as far as 6300BP. In the past the east coast of the North Island has been subjected to a number of both locally and distantly generated tsunami (de Lange and Healy, 1986). Most coastal regions of New Zealand have experienced some impact from tsunami. However, most tsunami have impacted only on the east coast of the country. This region is one of the most seismically active regions around New Zealand due to its location approximately 150 km to the west of the subduction boundary between the Pacific and Australian plates (Chagué-Goff et al, 2002), and the exposure of the country to tsunami of pan-pacific origins (de Lange and Healy, 1986). New Zealand earthquakes rarely cause significant tsunamis (Gusiakov, 2005). However, several tsunamis in the New Zealand historical record have been caused by local earthquakes. The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake generated a tsunami with maximum wave run-up of 10m in eastern Palliser Bay and 4-5m at locations in the Wellington region and along the northern Marlborough coast (Eiby, 1982a), the Napier earthquake of 3 February 1931 caused a rotational slump into the Waikari estuary in northern Hawke's Bay which caused a local tsunami with a recorded estimated run-up of 15.2m (Bryant, 2001) and in 1947 two separate local tsunamis with maximum wave heights of approximately 10m occurred near Gisborne following earthquakes off the east coast of the North Island during March and May 1947 (Eiby, 1982a). Figure 2.1 shows damage caused by the March, 1947 event near Gisborne.

The two largest distant source tsunami to arrive at the New Zealand coast followed earthquakes off the coast of Chile in 1868 and 1960 (Walters et al, 2006; de Lange and Healy, 1986). Figure 2.2 shows damage to the Ahuriri footbridge in Napier following the 1960 Chilean tsunami. Of the 32 historical tsunamis identified by de Lange and Healy (1986), one fatality has been recorded. This fatality occurred on the Chatham Islands during the tsunami of 15 August 1868 where it has been reported that one person drowned (Laing, 1954; Eiby, 1968).

Chapter 2 2.3.3 Tsunami Risk in New Zealand

Background Information

Risk can be calculated as the outcome of the probability of an event occurring and a measure of the consequences of an event (Centre for Advanced Engineering, 1997). The risk of a tsunami is present for all coastal areas of New Zealand (Eiby, 1968). Berryman (2005) found that New Zealand is subject to relatively high levels of risk from a tsunami, and this risk is still present even if tsunami warning systems are in place. The impact that a tsunami will have on our coastlines increases each year with increasing development along our coastal margins, and it can be expected that future tsunamis worldwide will have a greater impact (both social and economic impacts) on coastal communities than tsunami have done in the past (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, 1987; Paras-Carayannis, 1988; de Lange, 2003).

2.4

RISK PERCEPTION

How people perceive risk is important in predicting how members of a community will prepare for hazards and respond in the face of a hazard (Drabek, 1996; Peacock et al, 2005). However, following a natural disaster a community's collective memory will fade following long periods with no hazard occurring (Woo, 1999). The behavior of individuals in the face of a hazard is governed by their perception of risk. Previous experience, cultural conditioning, and personal traits are all likely to affect and influence an individual's perceived risk (Drabek, 1996; Espiner, 1999; AndersonBerry, 2003), however it is only when a person perceives a hazard as critical that the hazard is likely to motivate them into taking protective behaviour (Paton, 2003).

Risk is related to vulnerability (Papathoma et al, 2003), and the way in which people perceive risk and the fact that people often perceive risk in different ways than other members of the same community, can mean that some people can become more vulnerable to natural hazard events than other members of the community who are facing the same ordeal (Twigg, 2003).

11

Chapter 2 2.5 HAZARD VULNERABILITY

Background Information

Vulnerability can be defined as a person or group of people's ability to predict, resist, cope with, and recover from the impact of a natural hazard (Blaikie et al, 1994). People in coastal communities are vulnerable to the threat of tsunami because of their close proximity to the ocean. Visitors to an area generally have little knowledge of hazards associated with the area they are visiting compared to resident populations, hence, they become more vulnerable in the face of a hazard event (Drabek, 1994). Wisner (2004) identifies a number of groups who are typically vulnerable in any hazard situation in any given location. These groups include residents of group accommodation (people living in apartment blocks or hostels where emergency evacuation can be hindered due to the number of people trying to evacuate the building), the elderly (particularly the frail), physically or mentally disabled people, ethnic minorities (due to language barriers), large concentrations of children (such as kindergartens or schools), homeless people, and tourists. Preparation and education can help to reduce community vulnerability.

2.6

TSUNAMI PREPAREDNESS

In order to reduce community vulnerability and increase resilience, it is necessary for community members as well as central and local government authorities to be adequately prepared to deal with a hazard. The false-alarm tsunami warning for the east coast of New Zealand following an earthquake off Tonga on 4 May 2006 raised concerns over New Zealanders' level of preparedness (The Gisborne Herald, 6 May 2006 p. 1) and less than a fortnight after this event a report by Chen, Palmer and Partners was released (Neville, 2006), which called for immediate changes to be made to the Governments emergency management plan. The report labeled the New Zealand government's emergency planning as "unlawful, unclear, and insufficient" (Neville, 2006). On 17 May 2006 an international exercise- `Exercise Pacific Wave `06' was conducted for all countries surrounding the Pacific Ocean in order to evaluate communication links for message dissemination. This was the first international Pacific-wide tsunami warning test conducted, and 40 countries from around the Pacific took part (ICG-PTWS, 2006). The exercise placed all countries in 12

Chapter 2

Background Information

the Pacific Basin in a distant source tsunami warning situation. In New Zealand the exercise was led and coordinated by the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management (MCDEM). Local Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) groups and other organizations (NZ Police, NZFS, MoH, GNS Science, NIWA, NELC, University of Waikato, and Auckland University) participated in the format and the aims and objectives of the exercise. The scenario for New Zealand focused on a magnitude 9.2 earthquake off the central Chilean coast. For all countries that participated in the exercise the time scale was compressed by a factor of 4, meaning that each hour in real time covered 4 hours in scenario time, however CDEM groups around New Zealand decided that the compressed time factor of 4 was not practical to achieve the New Zealand objectives and it was therefore decided to run the scenario in real time for the first 4 hours, and then revert to a compressed time factor of 2. This allowed for the scenario 15 hour wave approach period to occur within a time frame of 9 hours (Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management, 2006). At a regional level CDEM groups received National advisories/warnings and information from MCDEM who had received the information from the PTWC. CDEM groups then activated the appropriate regional management groups, and following interaction with the MCDEM, considered and assessed all of the available information. It had been decided that the exercise would not involve the public and therefore no public warning systems would be issued (Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management, 2006). Overall the exercise was reported a success, with 80% of the national CDEM participating in the exercise. The National report claims that only positive comments from participants were received in relation to conducting the exercise. However, the scientific advisors disagree with this and found that their input was largely ignored, and the resulting decisions were poor (de Lange, W. 2007, pers. comm..; 2 February). The national report found that it was also felt that compressing the scenario time frame had a negative impact on the quality of the information that was produced. Therefore, it was recommended that future exercises must as far as possible be conducted in real time (Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management, 2006).

Previous studies of a communities' tsunami preparedness include Johnston et al, (2003) and Johnston et al, (2005). The National Coastal Community Survey in 2003 13

Chapter 2

Background Information

was one of the first of its kind in New Zealand in which residents from 42 New Zealand coastal communities were surveyed in order to build a picture into the social dynamics at work in coastal communities, and community members' perceptions of, and preparedness for managing coastal hazards. In 2005 a survey of over 300

residents and non-residents along the west coast of Washington State was conducted to determine respondents' perceptions of tsunami risk. This study found that levels of tsunami preparedness amongst members of the community was low to moderate, although hazard education has been relatively successful in terms of promoting awareness of tsunamis and residents of coastal Washington have good access to information on tsunami hazards.

In recent years New Zealand has begun to prepare more effectively for natural disasters through the introduction of the Civil Defence and Emergency Mangement Act 2002 (Webb, 2005), and the release of the tsunami reviews in 2005. In June 2006 New Zealand television began to screen advertisements advising the public on how to prepare for a natural disaster, which will hopefully lead to higher levels of understanding and preparedness amongst the public in the event of a natural hazard event in New Zealand. In October 2006 a new online database, `Readynet' was launched for Lower Hutt City that could help communities respond in the face of an emergency. The database collects information from community groups, schools and resthomes for emergency services to access, and during a disaster will send mass text alerts to the public with details and advice (Watt, 2006). Many other similar initiatives have been undertaken by CDEM groups over the past four years to improve community resilience (Johnston, D, 2007, pers. comm., 2 February).

2.7

TSUNAMI WARNINGS

Warning systems are vital in order to reduce the risk to life and damage to property from the devastating effects of a tsunami. Tsunami warnings allow for potentially devastating effects of wave inundation at coastal communities to be mitigated by action by hazard managers and local authorities. The more accurate the warnings are, the more effective emergency actions can be and therefore, more lives and property can be saved (Titov et al, 2005). Until the event of the Indian Ocean Boxing Day 14

Chapter 2

Background Information

2004 tsunami, the most devastating ocean-wide tsunamis of the previous 200 years had all occurred in the Pacific Ocean (Bryant, 2001). Following the Alaskan tsunami of 1946, a tsunami warning system for the Pacific was established by the United States government. This warning system was initially known as the Seismic Sea Wave Warning System; however by 1948 this had evolved into the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC). These warnings were initially issued only for the United States and Hawaiian regions, but following the Chilean earthquake of 22 May 1960, the warnings were extended to include all countries around the Pacific Ocean (Bryant, 2005). The PTWC is designed to provide rapid notification of any tsunami threat to members of the International Tsunami Warning System for the Pacific (ITSU) (Rabinovich and Stephenson, 2004).

On 26 December 2004, the PTWC issued an earthquake bulletin following the Sumatran earthquake. Initial data put the magnitude of the earthquake at 8.0, and it wasn't until new data arrived that the magnitude of the quake was revised to 8.5 and a tentative local tsunami warning was issued. This warning was issued almost an hour after the initial quake had occurred. At the time there were no established protocols in place to communicate this warning to authorities in the affected countries, and a lack of wave instrumentation in the Indian Ocean (such as the Deep Ocean Assessment and Reporting Tsunami (DART) buoys, or tidal gauges with telemetry), which operate in the Pacific Ocean, meant that the PTWC was unaware of the exact characteristics of the wave. It was not until Internet news reports arrived that the suspected tsunami was confirmed (King, 2005).

Ideally warning systems detect impending disaster and pass this information to people at risk, allowing them to make decisions and take action in the face of disaster (Sorenson, 2000). At present early tsunami warning systems in New Zealand are only in place for distant source tsunami (Webb, 2005). There is not always time for warnings to be issued following a possible tsunami generating earthquake. If an earthquake occurs locally the first tsunami waves could occur within as little time as 30 minutes following the earthquake (Washington Military Department, 2006). It is therefore important that members of the public are made aware of what the natural signs that a tsunami may have been generated are. 15

Chapter 2 2.7.1 Natural tsunami warning signs

Background Information

Natural signs of tsunami help to provide warning of an impending tsunami in areas where no official tsunami warning system exists, or for local source tsunamis where there is no time for an official tsunami warning to be issued (Gregg et al, 2007). Natural signs that a tsunami may have been generated include ground shaking from an earthquake, unusual sounds, unusual wave forms, and unusual sea-level variations (e.g. a receding of the shoreline) (Gregg et al, 2006). In many instances natural signs may be the only warning that occurs. Therefore, it is necessary that the public are adequately educated about what these natural warning signs are and act accordingly.

2.8

EVACUATION

The term evacuation can be used to describe the mass departure of people from a certain area because of a real or anticipated threat or hazard (Vogt and Sorensen, 1992). In the event of an impending natural hazard not all people in a community will evacuate. Evacuation research indicates that whether or not a person evacuates from an area in the event of a hazard depends on a number of factors including perception of risk, previous experience of a natural hazard (Peacock et al, 2005), the severity of the threat, and whether or not a warning had been received and understood (Baker, 1991). There has been very little research conducted into evacuation of visitors from areas where a hazard has occurred (Drabek, 1996). 2.8.1 Evacuation in New Zealand

There have been two incidents in the past of the New Zealand public evacuating following official tsunami warnings. The first occurred in May 1960 and the second in March 1964 (de Lange, W.P. 2006, pers. comm., 14 December). The most well remembered evacuations occurred following the May 1960 official warning, and the unofficial tsunami warning which occurred following the Tongan earthquake on 4 May, 2006.

Evacuation following the 1960 Chilean Earthquake and tsunami On 22 May 1960 at 19.11 UT (Universal Time) an earthquake occurred in southern Chile (Johnston et al, Submitted). The magnitude of the earthquake was estimated to be about 8.5 (Dudley and Lee, 1988), but has since been revised to 9.5 (de Lange, 16

Chapter 2

Background Information

W.P. 2007, pers. comm.., 2 February). This earthquake generated a tsunami that swept across the Pacific Ocean and caused major loss of life in Chile, Hawaii and Japan. The tsunami arrived in New Zealand without warning on the evening of 23 May 1960 (NZST) and caused widespread damage in a number of coastal communities. Fortunately no loss of life occurred (Johnston et al, In Press). Three days later (NZST) on 26 May 1960 a large aftershock occurred in Chile and fears following the earlier tsunami led to the broadcasting over radio of a nationwide tsunami warning in New Zealand. This warning resulted in a number of East Coast communities evacuating to higher ground. Also some schools in low-lying areas were closed and the children either sent home or to higher ground (Johnston et al, Submitted). Along with those who evacuated to safe areas, there are also reports of `sightseeing' in a number of coastal communities with members of the public moving into risky areas to observe the approaching tsunami (Johnston et al, Submitted). Figure 2.3 shows residents gathering at the Napier wharf to watch the expected tsunami.

Chapter 2

Background Information

Evacuation following the unofficial tsunami warning on 4 May, 2006 At 3.27am (NZST) on Thursday 4 May 2006 an earthquake occurred off the coast of Tonga. Initially the earthquake was reported as having a magnitude of Mw 8.1 on the which lead to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre in Hawaii issuing a tsunami warning for the east coast of New Zealand approximately 15 minutes after the earthquake. Just over an hour after the earthquake, the PTWC issued a second bulletin revising the earthquake magnitude down to magnitude 7.8 (Downes et al, 2006) and at this stage the warning for New Zealand was cancelled (Waikato Times, 4 May 2006, p. 1).

The devastating tsunami of 26 December 2004 and related media coverage possibly made people more aware of the effects a tsunami can have on a region- and may have contributed to some people in the Gisborne and Hawke's Bay areas self-evacuating following early information issued by the BBC and CNN news channels that a tsunami had been generated. Several hundred people did move to high ground (Figure 2.4) or inland that morning (Waikato Times, 4 May 2006, p. 1; The Gisborne Herald, 6 May 2006 p. 1). However, it appears that many people did not respond in the correct way and instead headed to the beach (Waikato Times, 4 May 2006, p. 1).

A phone survey of Gisborne and Napier/Hastings residents was conducted over the following 2 weeks in order to establish what percentage of the population heard about the warnings and self-evacuated following the media warnings, and to establish the different sources that information came from, and what led to people making the decisions they made on that morning. Initial findings show that approximately 2% of Gisborne residents who were surveyed reported some form of evacuation behaviour (one person evacuated to a nearby hill, and another person started to collect together supplies but then heard that the warning had been cancelled and stopped). No one from the Napier/Hastings area reported any form of evacuation behaviour. In Gisborne, 61% of those surveyed reported receiving information about the warning, with 31% giving phone calls as the first source of information. This contrasts with only 16% of those surveyed in Napier/Hastings who reported receiving information about the warning, with 7% of Napier/Hastings surveyed residents reporting that

phone calls were their first source of information (Leonard, G. 2006, pers. comm., 4 October).

SUMMARY

Hawke's Bay and Gisborne are among the most at risk areas from tsunami inundation in the country (Berryman, 2005), and are at risk from both locally generated and distant source tsunami (Eiby, 1982a; de Lange and Healy, 1986; Berryman, 2005). The following chapters present three separate surveys conducted in Gisborne and Hawke's Bay during 2006. These studies examine community understanding of, and preparedness for tsunami hazard.

CAMPING GROUND VISITOR SURVEYS

Chapter 3 3.1 THE CAMPING GROUND SURVEYS

The camping ground surveys

It is likely that visitors to a region have little understanding of natural hazard events in the area they are visiting. Therefore, they are made vulnerable because they have not been informed of potential hazards in the region, or what actions to take should a natural hazard occur.

The camping ground survey was designed to obtain information on how visitors to camping grounds in Hawke's Bay understand tsunami risk in the area. It looks at specific aspects associated with visitor understanding of tsunami hazard such as understanding of warnings (both natural warning signs and official warning systems), what actions to take in the event of a tsunami warning, and who they feel is responsible for issuing official tsunami warnings. The survey also looks at how peoples' perceptions may have changed following the Sumatran earthquake and consequent tsunami on 26 December 2004.

The results of this survey can be used by GNS Science and the Hawke's Bay Regional Council to gain an understanding of visitor perceptions of tsunami risk in Hawke's Bay.

3.1.2 Site description of the camping grounds The five camping grounds used for the survey are Bay View Snapper Holiday Park, Westshore Holiday Park, Kennedy Park Motor Camp, Te Awanga camping ground, and Clifton Motor Camp. Figure 3.1 shows the location of each site.

METHODS

The specific objectives of the camping ground visitor survey were (1) to assess visitors knowledge of tsunami risk in the area they are visiting; (2) to assess how prepared visitors are to deal with tsunami events; (3) to assess visitor understanding of tsunami warnings in Hawke's Bay; (4) to assess what actions visitors would take in the event of a tsunami warning, and what their understanding of tsunami travel times is; and (5) to assess how visitors perceptions of tsunami may have changed following the Sumatran earthquake and tsunami on 26 December 2004.

Specific questions were drawn up to address these objectives and the draft was subjected to a consultation process. The finalized questionnaire was completed in December 2005 and consisted of a total of 26 questions addressing the set objectives. A copy of the camping ground visitor survey can be seen in appendix A.

110 interviews were conducted at 5 camping grounds in the Napier, Hawke's Bay area between January and March 2006. Visitors were randomly selected from people 21

Chapter 3

The camping ground surveys

present in the camping grounds. Interviews were face-to-face and each survey took approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. The questions in the survey were separated into 5 categories: personal information; knowledge of risk; preparation and warnings; during a tsunami; and changes in perception.

Following completion of the interviews each survey question was coded and the data were entered and analysed using SPSS version 13.

3.3

RESULTS FOR THE CAMPING GROUND SURVEYS

This section presents the results for the camping ground surveys. Except where stated, the results have been presented as a total for all camping grounds. Tabulated results for the camping grounds can be seen in Appendix B. The results are drawn from the responses of 110 individuals at 5 camping grounds within Hawke's Bay.

The results section is divided in five broad categories for ease of interpretation. The first section describes the sample in terms of personal information such as visitor type, number of days on average they spend visiting the camping ground, number of years on average they have been visiting for, where they originate from, gender, age, and whether they have had any previous tsunami experience. The following sections examine knowledge of risk, preparation and warnings, what actions visitors would take in the event of a tsunami, and how perceptions have changed since the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2006.

3.3.1 PERSONAL INFORMATION

Visitor type Visitor types have been separated into 4 distinct groups: overnight visitors (e.g. those respondents who spend at least one night at the camping ground), day visitors (those respondents who are visiting the camping ground for the day only), permanent residents and employees. The majority (80.9%) of respondents at all camping grounds were overnight visitors, 3.6% were day visitors, 10% were permanent 22

Chapter 3 residents and 5.5% were employees.

Number of days on average spent at the camping ground Overnight visitors spend an average of 19.4 days per year at the camping grounds. Day visitors spend an average of 1 day per year visiting. As can be expected permanent residents and employees spend considerably more days per year visiting, the average number of days permanent residents spend at the camping grounds is 292 days, and employees spend an average of 279 days per year.

Number of years visiting On average overnight visitors have been visiting the camping grounds for 6.6yrs (range1-13 years), day visitors have been visiting for 0.6 years (range 1-2 years), permanent residents 4.8 years (range 3-9 years), and employees 6.4 years (range 1-20 years).

Visitor origin Most respondents (49.1%) originated from elsewhere in New Zealand. However, a large proportion (46.4%) live in the Hawke's Bay region. Only 4.5% of those surveyed were from abroad. These results can be further broken down by respondent type. 100% of respondents who originated from abroad were overnight visitors as opposed to being day visitors, permanent residents or employees. Of those respondents who originated from elsewhere in New Zealand the majority (87%) were 23

overnight visitors, 5.6% were day visitors, and 5.6% were employees. 72.5% of respondents from the Hawke's Bay region were overnight visitors, 2% were day visitors, 21.2% were permanent residents, and 5.9% were employees.

Previous tsunami experience When asked whether they had had previous tsunami experience the majority of respondents (91.8%) answered `no'. It is interesting to compare age group with those respondents who answered `yes' (3.6%) or said that they had experienced a false tsunami warning (4.5%). It was found that all respondents who answered that they had had some previous tsunami experience were in the 51+ age group. All respondents who answered that they had had previous tsunami experience indicated that this related to the 1960 Chilean tsunami.

Chapter 3 3.3.2 KNOWLEDGE OF TSUNAMI RISK

The camping ground surveys

This section investigates respondent's knowledge of tsunami risk in relation to the camping ground they are visiting, their understanding of when the last tsunami that caused damage in Hawke's Bay occurred, and their perception of when they think the next tsunami will occur in Hawke's Bay.

Visitor perception of how likely tsunami are to affect the camping ground Westshore camping ground had the highest percentage (78.5%) of respondents who thought that a tsunami was likely to affect the area. This was closely followed by Bay View camping ground (72.7%), and Kennedy Park camping ground (71.4%). Of the respondents at Clifton camping ground only 69% of respondents thought that a tsunami was likely to affect the area, while at Te Awanga camping ground only 57.1% thought that a tsunami was likely to occur. It is interesting to further separate the responses by visitor type at each camping ground. Table 3.1 shows the percentage of each visitor type at each camping ground who thought that a tsunami would be likely to affect the area.

Last damaging tsunami that occurred in Hawke's Bay Respondents at each of the 5 camping grounds were asked when they thought the last tsunami that caused damage in Hawke's Bay occurred. 4.5% of respondents thought that a damaging tsunami had never occurred in Hawke's Bay, 0.9% thought in the last 1-10 years, 30% thought in the last 10-100 years, 0.9% thought in the last 100-1000 years, and 63.6% of respondents indicated that they did not know when the last damaging tsunami had occurred in Hawke's Bay.

Table 3.3 gives a breakdown of when each of the different visitor types thinks that the next tsunami might occur in Hawke's Bay. This is useful, as by separating the respondent types it is possible to gain an understanding into how permanent residents and employees responses may differ from visitors' responses. This may help to determine levels of understanding of employees, which can help in determining the preparedness of camping ground staff for managing possible tsunami events in the future.

3.3.3 PREPARATION AND WARNINGS

This section looks at respondents' preparedness for tsunami hazard and their understanding of tsunami warnings. It investigates from where respondents may have actively sought information, or heard or received information about tsunamis from, 29

Chapter 3

The camping ground surveys

where they think New Zealand tsunami come from, who they think is responsible for issuing tsunami warnings (both locally generated tsunami warnings and distantly generated tsunami warnings), whether they think that New Zealand has a tsunami warning system, what they think the New Zealand tsunami public notification system consists of, what they think is the most effective way of delivering a tsunami warning to the public, if they know what the natural signs of a tsunami or signs that a tsunami may have been generated are, and the order in which they would prefer to receive a tsunami warning.

Actively sought information on tsunamis Only a very small percentage (7.3%) of respondents had actively sought information on tsunamis. Figure 3.9 shows where respondents had actively sought information on tsunamis from.

It is interesting to note (Table 3.4) that very few overnight visitors had sought information on tsunamis, and permanent residents had not sought any information on tsunamis. Only 2 employees had actively sought information on tsunamis which causes some concern as employees would be the first contact point for many people visiting camping grounds.

There was a greater percentage of overnight visitors opposed to other respondent types who had heard or received the most information from any source.

New Zealand Tsunami When asked where they thought New Zealand tsunami come from 38.2% of respondents interviewed indicated that they did not know. 27.3% said that they came from the Pacific Ocean, 16.4% said from South America, 8.2% said from Chile, 0.9% said that they came from Asia, 1.8% said from Australia, 0.9% said from the tropics, 0.9% said from Tonga, 0.9% said from the Hikurangi Trench, 2.7% said they came from earthquakes, and 1.8% said they came from landslides.

Other answers were radio warnings (13.6%), TV announcements (3.6%), and Sirens (36.4%). 2.7% of respondents answered that the New Zealand public notification system consisted of some other type of warning. These people said that it consisted of the Pacific 37

Overnight visitors and permanent residents had the greatest understanding of what the New Zealand public tsunami warning notification system consists of (Table 3.10). The majority of employees surveyed indicated that they did not know which is of concern due to employees often being the first contact point for a number of camping ground visitors. This issue is further explored in Chapter 4.

Chapter 3 Most effective way of delivering a warning

The camping ground surveys

Respondents were asked what they thought was the most effective way of delivering a tsunami warning to the public. The majority (69.1%) said that they thought sirens would be the most effective way of delivering a warning. Other ways which people thought would be most effective were radio (16.4%), television (1.8%), the internet (0.9%), TXT message (0.9%), Loud speakers (1.8%), word of mouth (0.9%), the fire service/ local police warning people (2.7%), loud shouting (0.9%), media coverage (1.8%), and a helicopter with loud speakers flying around warning people (1.8%). 0.9% of respondents answered that they did not know what the most effective way of warning people would be.

Figure 3.16: Respondents ideas of the most effective way of delivering a tsunami warning

Respondents ideas as to the most effective way for receiving a tsunami warning was similar across all respondent types (Table 3.11) with the majority of all respondent types indicating that they thought the most effective way of delivering a tsunami warning was by siren. Although sirens are the most common form of public notification, they are a relatively difficult option to make effective due to maintenance and testing requirements, and the difficulty associated with developing understanding and response (Leonard et al, 2006).

Natural signs of a tsunami In many cases natural signs may be the only warning that exists. For example in areas where no official warning system is set-up, or in the instance of a local-source tsunami where there is no time to issue an official tsunami warning (Gregg et al, 2006a). When asked what the natural signs of a tsunami are, or signs that a tsunami may have been generated, the majority (67.3%) of respondents said that receding water was a natural sign, 14.5% said an earthquake, 6.4% said a large wave, 3.6% said that birds flying away was a natural sign, 11.8% indicated that they did not know, and 10.9% answered other. Other answers included higher than usual tides, calm seas, animals moving inland, and a rumbling noise.

Preference for receiving a tsunami warning Respondents were asked to list their preference for receiving a tsunami warning. Preferred warning methods that respondents indicated were: radio, TV, media, siren, TXT message, newspaper, internet, police, and other. Other preferred warnings included helicopters with loud speakers, loud speaker announcements, Civil Defence notification, official verbal warnings, and notification from camping ground staff. As can be seen in figure 3.18 sirens were by far the most preferred method of receiving a warning with over 70% of respondents answering that sirens were their preferred method for receiving a tsunami warning. 41

3.3.4 DURING A TSUNAMI This section looks at respondents' actions and expectations during a tsunami. It investigates what actions respondents would take in the event of both distant-source tsunami warnings, and local-source tsunami warnings, and looks into visitor understanding of how much time they would have to move to safety in the event of a distant or local-source tsunami. It also investigates what (if anything) visitors expect from camping ground accommodation staff in the event of a tsunami.

Actions in the event of a distant-source, official tsunami warning In the event of a distant-source, official tsunami warning being issued, the majority (52.7%) of respondents said that they would move to high ground. 8.2% said that they would take supplies and move to high ground, 16.4% said that they would move inland, 4.5% said that they would take supplies and move inland. A further 13.6% of respondents said that they would just leave, and 3.6% said they would leave but would take supplies with them. 0.9% of respondents said they would take another action (climb a tree).

The Chilean tsunami of 22 May 1960 was the last damaging tsunami to occur in Hawke's Bay. The tsunami occurred without warning, and although no loss of life occurred, there was considerable damage done to a number of coastal facilities around New Zealand (de Lange and Healy, 1986; Johnston et al, submitted). A large aftershock which occurred three days later resulted in a nationwide tsunami warning being broadcast (Johnston et al, submitted). The expected tsunami never arrived. However, thousands of people in coastal communities around the country were reported to have evacuated, making this the largest evacuation in the history of New Zealand (Johnston et al, submitted). There were also reports of large numbers of people ignoring the warnings and instead moving to the coast in order to watch the approaching tsunami. There was much discussion following this event of a need to improve both the national tsunami warning system and the awareness of the New Zealand public of the risks of such an event (Johnston et al, submitted). However, over the next 40 years until the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004, public awareness of tsunami, and the preparedness of the New Zealand public diminished (Webb, 2005; Johnston et al, submitted).

The camping ground survey found that very few of the respondents surveyed in the camping grounds had had any previous tsunami experience. Those that did indicated that this related to the Chilean tsunami of May 1960.

Knowledge of tsunami risk was found to be low with the majority of respondents indicting that they did not know when the last damaging tsunami occurred in Hawke's Bay, and perception of tsunamis (both how likely visitors thought a tsunami was to affect the camping ground, and when they thought the next tsunami might occur in Hawke's Bay) was also low. Public perception of risk is an important factor in hazard assessment as it is an indicator of how well citizens will prepare for, and respond to the threat of a hazard (Peacock et al, 2005).

Preparedness for tsunami events was very low amongst all respondent types with very few having actively sought any information on tsunamis. Employees at the camping 52

grounds and any tourism establishment are often the first points of contact for tourists, and it would be desirable for staff to be more prepared and knowledgeable in order to reduce the risk to visitors. It is also concerning to note that very few respondents had heard or received information about tsunamis from any source.

When asked what the New Zealand public tsunami notification system consists of over half of those surveyed indicated that they did not know. Furthermore, when asked what their preferred method for receiving a tsunami warning would be, the majority of respondents said that warning sirens would be their preferred method. Although sirens are the most commonly suggested form of warning, there are difficulties associated with communities understanding and response to sirens. Further, the testing and maintenance of such systems tends to make them a relatively difficult option to make effective (Leonard et al, 2006). There are also problems associated with warning community members who may be in remote areas e.g. people on rural coastal properties, surfcasters etc. (Leonard et al, 2006).

Education is an important tool for ensuring that society is aware of the risks of a hazard, and for helping to better prepare communities for hazard events. It would be advisable that CDEM groups work with staff at the camping grounds to provide information that can be used by staff members to ensure that they are prepared for a tsunami in the area. Furthermore, this could then be passed on to people staying in the camping ground, to ensure that they too have an understanding of the risk of tsunamis in the area, and what to do in the event of such an event occurring. Clearly such provisions would also help to provide employees and visitors with information on who is responsible for issuing tsunami warnings. This would clarify for the number of respondents who do not know if New Zealand has a tsunami warning system that such systems are present for distant source tsunamis (Webb, 2005). Due to the short time period involved between generation of a local source tsunami, and the arrival time on our coasts (0-60 minutes) (Berryman, 2005), it is difficult to provide warning for local source tsunami. Therefore the public need to be aware of the natural signs of a tsunami, or signs that a tsunami may have been generated; for example ground shaking from an earthquake if at the coast, unusual sounds, wave forms, and sea level

53

fluctuations (Gregg et al, 2006) in order to be prepared for such an event and reduce the risk to themselves.

This survey found that knowledge of the natural signs of a tsunami, or signs that a tsunami may have been generated, was relatively high amongst respondents. However, there were a percentage of respondents who said that they did not know what the natural signs of a tsunami were. Ronan and Johnston (2005) discuss the role of schools, youth and families in promoting community resilience to disasters, and because schools are a central part of any community, and the children of today are the adults of tomorrow, it is important to bring hazard education into this area. The role that formal education can play in informing people of tsunami risk was highlighted in Thailand during the tsunami of 26 December, 2004, when a 10-year-old English girl, Tilly Smith, alerted an unknown number of people around her to evacuate from the beach because she recognized the natural warning signs of the approaching tsunami from education she had gained in a geography class at school (King and Gurtner, 2005; Gregg et al, 2006). However, traditional knowledge handed down through informal education is another way for people to become more knowledgeable of the signs of a natural hazard. The indigenous Moken people of the Andaman Sea area were among those who made the link between the receding sea prior to the Boxing Day 2004 tsunami, and imminent tsunami danger (Gregg et al, 2006). The links between the traditional knowledge of the Moken people and formal education such as Tilly Smith received highlights the need for people to be educated about tsunami risk through both traditional methods and through formal scientific education (Gregg et al, 2006).

It was encouraging to note that the majority of respondents at the camping grounds said that in the event of either a distant or local source tsunami they would move to high ground or inland, however few said that they would take supplies with them. This illustrates the need for people to be adequately prepared with a survival kit for such events, so that they are self reliant in the event of a disaster occurring. Understanding of how much time they would have to move to safety in the event of either a local or distant source tsunami was also low.

54

Chapter 3

The camping ground surveys

Distant source tsunamis are defined as having more than three hours travel time to the nearest coastline. Major sources of tsunami generation are a least 10 hours travel time from New Zealand, therefore there should be adequate time for authorities to provide timely warnings to CDEM groups and the New Zealand public (Webb, 2005). However, the majority of respondents in the camping ground survey either did not know how much time they would have to move to safety, or believed that they would have less than two hours. When asked how much time they would have to move to safety if they felt a strong earthquake while at the beach, the majority of respondents correctly said somewhere between a few minutes and half an hour. There was also a high percentage of respondents who indicated that they did not know, and a few people who over estimated the time they would have to move to safety. Local source tsunami are defined by Webb (2005) as having less than an hours travel time from the nearest New Zealand coastline. However, many may have less than 30 minutes travel time, and some can have travel times as short as 10 minutes (Webb, 2005). It is concerning to note that understanding of tsunami travel times is low amongst camping ground employees, especially as the majority of visitors and permanent residents at the camping ground said that in the event of a tsunami they would expect some form or warning, evacuation information, or a set of instructions from staff.

The majority of respondents said that they had an understanding of what a tsunami was before the Boxing Day 2004 tsunami. Webb (2005) speculated that the Boxing Day 2004 tsunami significantly increased awareness of the New Zealand to tsunami risk. This is reflected by the findings of this study where the majority of respondents at the camping grounds said that since this devastating event they have become more aware or have learnt more about tsunamis.

Chapter Four The Tourism Surveys
___________________________________________________________

Chapter 4 4.1 INTRODUCTION

The tourism surveys

The tourism industry is highly vulnerable to disaster and the effects that a disaster may have, and the unfamiliarity of tourists with the hazards that may occur in a region greatly contributes to this vulnerability (Méheux and Parker, 2006). Tourists are likely to become disorientated in the event of a hazard as they generally have very little understanding of the region they are visiting. When under the stress that the hazard event may produce tourists become more vulnerable, especially as they do not have the support resources that they would have when at home. It is therefore important that hotels and motels cater for the safety of both their employees and visitors (Johnston et al, submitted), and if the correct actions and preparations are taken by tourism managers this vulnerability can be reduced (Drabek, 1994). The tourism surveys were conducted in order to see how prepared the Hawke's Bay tourism sector is for managing natural hazard events, and looks at staff hazard training, emergency exercises such as drill and evacuation procedures, and what hazard signage is available for visitors. Although there have been a number of studies that look at reasons why residential populations evacuate before or after a disaster (e.g. Mileti et al, 1985; Sorenson, 1991; Bateman and Edwards, 2002), very little research has been conducted into the effects of disasters on tourists (Drabek, 2000). Hawke's Bay is a popular tourist destination and because of the high number of visitors at any one time in the region, and its setting in one of New Zealand's most earthquake prone zones which places it amongst the most at risk from tsunami areas in the country (Berryman, 2005) it is important to determine how prepared the tourism sector is for managing natural hazard events, in order to help to minimize the consequences that a hazard event may have on these transient populations.

This survey is identical to that used in a survey of tourism venues in Washington State, USA in September 2005 which was conducted to evaluate staff training for emergencies, emergency management exercises including drills and evacuation, and hazard signage within 18 hotels and motels in Ocean Shores, Washington State (Johnston et al, In Press). Therefore, it is possible to make comparisons between hazard preparedness in the tourism sector in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, and in Washington State, USA. 56

Chapter 4 4.2 METHODS

The tourism surveys

The specific objectives of the tourism survey were (1) to assess whether hotel/motel staff in the Hawke's Bay tourism sector had undergone any hazard training; (2) to assess whether exercises/drills are performed at the hotel/motel; and (3) to assess if the hotel/motel has any hazard signage in place.

Face-to-face interviews were conducted at 23 hotels and motels in Napier City in March 2006. The number of tourists that each venue can accommodate ranges between 29 and 300 overnight visitors, with a mean of 83 visitors. Clearly those hotels/motels located within 1km of the coastline are the most at risk from tsunami hazards, and therefore these hotels/motels were chosen as the focus of this study. Each interview consisted of 16 questions relating to staff hazard training, what emergency management procedures such as drills and evacuation exercises were conducted, and what hazard signage if any was in place. A copy of the survey can be seen in Appendix C. Each interview took a maximum of 15 minutes.

Figure 4.1: Locations of the 23 hotels/motels in Napier city that were surveyed.

Chapter 4 4.3 RESULTS

The tourism surveys

This section presents the results for the preparedness survey. The results are drawn from the responses to interviews conducted at 23 hotels/motels in Napier City, Hawke's Bay. The results are separated into 6 categories: Respondents role and accommodation details; Staff hazard training; Other training; Exercises; Signage; and Personal information. Tabulated results can be found in Appendix D.

4.3.1 RESPONDENT ROLE AND ACCOMMODATION DETAILS

Respondent role Of the 23 respondents that were surveyed 16 were the owners of the hotel/motel, 1 was the company director, 3 were managers, and 3 were receptionists.

Accommodation details The majority (83%) of accommodation venues surveyed were motels, while the remaining 17% were hotels. The number of rooms at each hotel/motel ranged between 9 and 109, and the number of people that can be accommodated at each accommodation venue ranged from 29 through to 300 people. When respondents were asked how many visitors' would come through each day there was a range from 12-1000 visitors per day. The hotel that had 1000 visitors per day has 2 popular restaurants and 3 bars attached which is the reason visitor numbers through the door are in excess of the other 22 venues. The number of staff that worked at each hotel/motel ranged from 2 through to 50, and the number of years that respondents had been with the company ranged between 3 months and 18 years.

4.3.2

STAFF HAZARD TRAINING

When respondents were asked whether they had ever received any training for dealing with emergencies the majority (57%) answered `no'. 10 (44%) of respondents had at some stage received training for dealing with emergencies.

COMPARISONS BETWEEN PREPAREDNESS OF THE HAWKE'S BAY, NEW ZEALAND TOURISM SECTOR AND THE TOURISM SECTOR IN OCEAN SHORES, WASHINGTON, USA.

In the 2005 preparedness survey of accommodation venues in Ocean Shores, Washington State, USA, it was found that the number of employees who had received training for hazards was low. Only 22% of those surveyed reported having received training on how to respond to hazard events (Johnston et al, In Press). In comparison, 44% of employees surveyed in the 2006 survey of accommodation venues in Napier, New Zealand, reported having received some form of training for responding to hazard events. However, no employees surveyed in the Napier survey had received any form of training for tsunamis. In the Ocean Shores survey four (22%) establishments had been exposed to training relating to how to respond to tsunami events, with one of the 18 surveyed reporting that they had an on-going training programme for tsunamis. This was the only Ocean Shores establishment that 66

Chapter 4

The tourism surveys

reported having regular drills and evacuation practices (Johnston et al, In Press), in contrast to 13 (57%) establishments in Napier that reported having exercises or drills.

In Ocean Shores all of the 18 accommodation establishments surveyed had signage for fire hazards. Four (22%) of these establishments had information available that gave information specifically on tsunamis, however only one of these accommodation venues had information on tsunami hazards available in every room (Johnston et al, In Press). In comparison, not all of the establishments surveyed in Napier had hazard signage in place, however the majority (96%) of the 23 establishments did. Only one establishment in Napier reported having signage relating to tsunamis however this was not specifically for tsunamis but also included fire and earthquake evacuation information. In contrast to Ocean Shores, all of the hotels/motels in Napier that did have hazard signage in place reported that signs were up in every room/unit.

4.5

DISCUSSION

A study by Drabek (1994) into disaster evacuation and the tourism industry found that the thinking and behaviour of tourism industry executives at three sites in the USA showed major vulnerability to natural disasters. The Hawke's Bay tourism sector does not appear to be very well prepared for managing hazard events in general, with only 44% of those surveyed indicating that they had received any form of training for managing natural hazard events, and no one indicating that they had received any form of training for tsunami events. There is also a noticeable lack of preparedness for tsunamis with only one establishment having hazard signage in place that referred to tsunamis in any way.

As discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, Hawke's Bay is at risk from both locally and distantly generated tsunamis. It would be appropriate for the Hawke's Bay Civil Defence and Emergency Management Group to look into ways for preparing the accommodation sector for managing tsunami events, and providing some form of training. Providing managers with an understanding into how people respond to and perceive risk will help to ensure that managers make more informed decisions about risk (Burns et al, 1993), which will help to ensure that the tourism sector is more 67

Chapter 4

The tourism surveys

prepared for hazard events. Following the 2005 survey of accommodation venues in Ocean Shores, Washington State, USA, Johnston et al (In Press) suggested that workshops could be organized by emergency management communities and key tourism managers in order to determine levels of knowledge of hazards, emergency procedures, and levels of understanding of visitors' needs and their expectations from tourism establishments. The Hawke's Bay Civil Defence and Emergency Management (CDEM) group should consider establishing similar workshops for the Hawke's Bay tourism sector, and training workshops on what actions to take in the event of a tsunami warning being issued would also be desirable.

THE 2006 NATIONAL COASTAL SURVEY

In June 2003 a National Coastal Survey was conducted to determine the levels of understanding and preparedness coastal community members have for coastal hazards (Johnston et al, 2003). Following the destructive Sumatran earthquake and consequent tsunami of 26 December 2004, it was decided that a resurvey of those community members who participated in the 2003 national coastal survey should be conducted to determine whether people's perceptions of tsunami hazard may have changed following this event.

5.1.1

Communities surveyed

In September 2006, a pilot survey was sent to 9 coastal communities around New Zealand. These communities were Wainui in Gisborne, Westshore, Haumoana and Te Awanga in Hawke's Bay, and New Brighton, South Shore, Sumner, Kaikoura, and Pareora in Canterbury. This thesis concentrates primarily on the surveys conducted in Gisborne and Hawke's Bay. Figure 5.1 shows the locations of the communities that were surveyed in Gisborne and Hawke's Bay.

69

Chapter 5 5.2 METHODS

2006 National Coastal survey

The specific objectives of the 2006 National Coastal Survey were (1) to determine community awareness of natural hazards (with a primary focus on tsunami hazard); and (2) to see how peoples' perceptions and understanding of tsunami risk may have changed following the Boxing Day 2004 tsunami. Specific questions were drawn up to meet these objectives, and the draft then underwent a wide-ranging consultation process. The final questionnaire contained 57 questions covering a variety of questions relating to awareness and experience of natural hazards, tsunamis and tsunami warnings and preparation, how respondents would react in the event of a tsunami, and demographical questions. A copy of the questionnaire is included in Appendix E.

A total of 700 questionnaires were delivered in the 4 coastal communities along the east coast of the North Island (Table 5.1). The survey numbers and the location were recorded to allow returned surveys to be identified in relation to the geographical area and the natural hazards related to that area, and to assess the return rate for each community. On return the questionnaires were then coded and analysed using SPSS version 13.

RESULTS FOR THE 2006 NATIONAL COASTAL SURVEY

This section presents the results for the 2006 National Coastal Survey. Only questions relating directly to tsunami are presented. Tabulated results can be seen in Appendix F.

The results section has been separated into 4 categories: General tsunami questions; Tsunami warnings and preparation; during a tsunami; and Demographics.

5.3.1 GENERAL TSUNAMI QUESTIONS

The following section presents the results of a number of general tsunami questions. Except where stated the results have been expressed as a total of all 4 communities.

Most frequent cause of tsunamis in general When asked what they thought the most frequent cause of tsunamis was the majority (90.2%) of respondents said earthquakes were the most frequent cause. 2.4% said volcanic eruptions and 2% said landslides. It is interesting to note that 2% of respondents believe that hurricanes/storms are the most frequent cause of tsunamis, and 1.5% thought that the high tide is the most frequent cause. 1.5% of respondents indicated that they did not know what the most frequent cause of a tsunami is.

Chapter 5 How tsunami waves can occur

2006 National Coastal survey

Respondents were asked how tsunami waves can occur. They were asked to tick all answers that they thought applied. The majority (61.5%) of respondents indicated that tsunami waves can occur as multiple big waves/surges, with 53.2% of respondents indicating that they could also occur as multiple big waves/surges and multiple small waves/surges. 50.2% answered that tsunami waves can occur as a rapidly rising and falling water . 44.9% answered that a tsunami will occur as one big wave/surge, 21% answered that it could occur as one small wave/surge, and 29.8% answered that a tsunami could occur as multiple small waves/surges. 6.8% of respondents indicated that they did not know how tsunami waves can occur.

5.3.2 TSUNAMI WARNINGS AND PREPARATION

The following section asks respondents a number of questions relating to tsunami warnings and how prepared they are for dealing with tsunamis.

Tsunami hazard zone maps Residents were asked if they had seen any tsunami hazard zone maps for their community. Wainui has maps readily available to the public on the Gisborne District Council website showing evacuation areas for distant source tsunami (Gisborne District Council, 2007). Hawke's Bay does not have hazard zone maps readily available to the public. However, in 2000 international data was used to create hazard zone maps, but these are not ideal as they are based on mathematical models and no local near shore bathymetry was used. NIWA has been contracted by the Hawke's Bay Regional Council to produce hazard zone maps which should be available in 2008 (Pearse, L. 2007 pers. Comm. 20 February). This question has been separated into responses from each of the 4 different communities.

Wainui When asked whether they had seen any tsunami hazard zone maps for their community the majority of residents at Wainui (66%) answered that they had seen tsunami hazard zone maps. 4% of residents were not sure, and 28% answered that they had not seen any tsunami hazard zone maps. Westshore The majority of residents at Westshore (69.7%) had not seen any tsunami hazard zone maps for their community. 22.4% of residents answered that they had seen tsunami hazard zone maps, and 7.9% were unsure if they had seen any. Haumoana 17.1% of residents at Haumoana had answered that they had seen tsunami hazard zone maps for their community however the vast majority (78%) of residents had not seen any tsunami hazard zone maps. 2.4% of residents were unsure if they had seen hazard zone maps for the Haumoana community.

Wainui The majority (90%) of Wainui residents answered that they live in a tsunami inundation zone. 6% said that they do not live in a tsunami inundation zone, while 2% did not know. Westshore 77.6% of Westshore residents live in a tsunami inundation zone. 2% answered that they do not, and 19.7% do not know if they live in a tsunami inundation zone or not. Haumoana 82.9% of residents at Haumoana answered that they do live in a tsunami inundation zone, 2.4% said that they do not, and 12.2% did not know. Te Awanga 73.7% of Te Awanga residents live in a tsunami inundation zone. 2.6% answered that they do not live in a tsunami inundation zone, and 21.1% do not know.

New Zealand public tsunami warning system Respondents were given a list of options and asked to tick all that apply in making up the New Zealand public tsunami warning system. The majority (76.6%) of respondents thought that radio/TV warnings make up the New Zealand public tsunami warning system, however this was very closely followed by sirens (76.1%). 42% of respondents thought that warnings are delivered door- to-door by emergency services or civil defence staff, 22% by loudspeaker announcements, and 6.3% by flashing lights. 1% of those surveyed ticked the `other' box. Other answers included warnings given by neighbours, and in one instance the respondent answered that nothing makes up the New Zealand public tsunami warning system. 8.8% of residents who responded to the question indicated that they do not know what makes up the New Zealand public tsunami warning system.

Only 9.8% of residents said that they would inform their friends and neighbours, while 2% said that they would seek further information before taking any action. 8.3% of respondents stated that they would evacuate, but did not indicate where to, and a further 8.3% said that they would leave, but also did not indicate where they would go to. 5.9% of respondents said that they would take some other action. Other answers included that they did not know what they would do, that they would run, freak out, would take important documents, would prepare family to leave, would offer assistance if needed, and would follow instructions. 89

How responses would differ for a distant source tsunami warning When respondents were asked to indicate how their response to a warning of a distant source tsunami warning would differ to their response to a local source tsunami warning the majority (40%) said that their response would not differ. 24.9% said that they would follow instructions, 17.1% said that they would pack and take supplies, and 3.4% said that they would inform their friends and neighbours. 15.6% of respondents said that they would take some other action. Other actions included waiting for more information, taking valuable possessions, and heading further inland than if it was a local source tsunami.

2006 National Coastal survey

Time to move to safety following an official tsunami warning When respondents were asked how much time they have to move to safety if they are at the coast and receive an official tsunami warning the majority (34.1%) answered that they did not know. 17.6% said they would have a few minutes, 20% said between 10 minutes- half an hour, 15.6% between half an hour- 1 hour, 6.3% said 1-2 hours, 2.9% said 2-5 hours, and 0.5% said more than 5 hours.

Figure 5.17: Understanding of the time to move to safety following an official tsunami warning.

It is interesting to note that a number of respondents also stated that the time to move to safety depends on the source of the tsunami, and whether or not the tsunami was local or distant. In New Zealand there are no warning systems in place for local source tsunami as there is very little time to get a warning to the public. An official tsunami warning will only be issued if the tsunami is from a distant source due to the difficulty of implementing local-source tsunami warnings (Webb, 2005). The public need to be made aware of this, and need to recognize natural warning signs in order to prepare for local source tsunami (Webb, 2005).

Time to move to safety if a strong earthquake is felt while at the beach Respondents were asked how much time they have to move to safety if they feel a strong earthquake while at the beach. A large percentage (33.7%) of residents indicated that they did not know, however it is interesting to note the all of the respondents said that they would have less than an hour to move to safety. 34.1% said they would only have a few minutes, 23.4% said 10 minutes ­ half an hour, and a small percentage (7.3%) said they would have half an hour ­ 1 hour. 91

Time between one tsunami wave/surge and the next When asked how much time there is between one tsunami wave/surge and the next the majority of respondents indicated that they do not know. 34.1% respondents said 1-15 minutes, 2.9% said 16-30 minutes, and 1% said there would be over 30 minutes. 23.4% answered that it could be all of the above.

Take personal belongings during a local source tsunami warning When respondents were asked if they would take personal belongings with them during a local source tsunami warning almost half (49.8%) said that they would, with 40.5% saying that they would not. 8.8% of respondents said that they did not know if they would take personal belongings or not.

Take personal belongings during a distant source tsunami warning The majority (81.5%) of respondents said that they would take personal belongings with them during a distant source tsunami warning. 9.8% said that they would not, while 7.8% indicated that they did not know if they would or not.

The three most important things in personal survival kit Respondents were asked to list the three most important items for their health/welfare if they currently had a personal survival kit.

92

Chapter 5

2006 National Coastal survey

The majority (55.6%) of respondents said water, 45.9% said food, 17.1% said medication, 29.3% clothing, 4.9% shelter, 2.9% Photo albums and/or personal mementos, 3.9% cash/card/wallet, 5.9% legal documents, 9.3% said radio, and 27.8% said that some other item was the most important for their personal health/welfare. Other items included First Aid kit, blankets/sleeping bags, car, cell phone, waterproof matches, pets, torch, and strong footwear.

Extent of agreement to how a tsunami will affect the respondent Respondents were asked to indicate how strongly they agree or disagree with the following statements.

I think tsunami could pose a threat to my personal safety The majority (54.6%) of respondents strongly agreed with the statement that tsunamis could pose a threat to their personal safety. 22% of respondents agreed, 14.1% thought maybe, 3.4% disagreed, and 3.9% strongly disagreed.

I think tsunami could pose a threat to my daily activities (such as work, leisure or property) Residents in Wainui, Gisborne appeared to be more of the attitude that tsunami would not pose at threat to their daily activities with 10% of respondents strongly disagreeing with the statement. This is almost 5% more than the attitudes of residents at Westshore in Napier, and close to 8% more than residents at Haumoana and Te Awanga. Overall however the majority (46.3%) of all residents from the four communities strongly agreed that tsunamis could pose a threat to their daily activities, 22.4% agreed, 14.6% thought a tsunami could maybe pose a threat to their daily activities, 5.9% disagreed, and 5.4% strongly disagreed.

The tsunami that may occur here won't be that bad When asked to what extent they agree or disagree with the statement that the tsunami that may occur here won't be that bad, the majority (45.4%) of residents strongly disagreed. 21.5% disagreed, 18% answered maybe, 6.8% agreed, and 3.4% strongly agreed with the statement.

93

Chapter 5 Tsunamis won't affect this area

2006 National Coastal survey

The majority (57.6%) of residents strongly disagreed with the statement that tsunamis won't affect their area. 17.6% disagreed, 10.2% thought maybe, 6.3% agreed with the statement, and 3.9% strongly agreed.

Tsunamis won't affect me 56.6% of residents strongly disagreed with the statement that tsunamis wouldn't affect them. 21.5% disagreed, 10.2% thought maybe, 3.4% agreed, and 3.9% strongly agreed.

The likelihood that major tsunamis will occur here has been greatly exaggerated When asked to which extent they agree or disagree with the statement that the likelihood that major tsunamis will occur here has been greatly exaggerated the majority (36.1%) of respondents strongly disagreed with the statement. 22.4% disagreed, 23.4% said maybe, 8.8% agreed, and 4.4% strongly agreed.

Tsunamis have affected this area since I have lived here Over half of all residents strongly disagreed with the statement that tsunamis have affected their area since they have lived there. 9.3% disagreed, 14.1% said maybe, 5.9% agreed, and 10.2% strongly agreed.

I will be fine if any tsunami hits here in the future When asked to which extent they agree or disagree with the statement `I will be fine if any tsunami hits here in the future' the majority (53.2% strongly disagreed. 16.6% disagreed, 13.2% said maybe, 4.9% agreed, and 7.3% strongly agreed that they would be fine if a tsunami hit their area in the future.

Components of community tsunami warning system Residents were asked to list the components of their community's tsunami warning system. This section has been separated into results for the four different communities.

94

Chapter 5 Wainui

2006 National Coastal survey

The majority of Wainui residents indicated that they either did not know if their community has a tsunami warning system (38%), or indicated that their community has a tsunami warning system but they do not know the components of it (36%). 14% of Wainui residents said that their community's warning system consists of a siren, 14% said loudspeaker, 12% TV and radio, and 18% door to door warnings. Westshore 35.5% of residents at Westshore said that their community tsunami warning system consisted of a siren, 2.6% said loudspeaker announcements, 11.8% said TV and radio, and 1.3% said other. Similar to Wainui residents the majority of Westshore residents indicated that they either do not know if their community has a tsunami warning system (32.9%), or said that their community has a tsunami warning system but that they do not know the components of it (30.3%). Haumoana 43.9% of Haumoana residents said that they do not know if their community has a tsunami warning system, and 22% said that there is a tsunami warning system but they do not know the components of it. 29.3% of residents said that the community tsunami warning system consists of a siren, 2.4% said TV and radio, and 4.9% said door to door warnings. Te Awanga 34.2% of residents at Te Awanga said that their community tsunami warning system consists of a siren, 2.6% said loudspeaker announcements, 18.4% said TV and radio, 10.5% said door to door warnings, and 13.2% said some other form of warning. 42.1% of residents did not know if their community had a tsunami warning system, and 7.9% said that their community does have a tsunami warning system but they do not know the components of it.

Advice given about what to do during a tsunami evacuation Respondents were asked to specify what advice they had been given about what to do during a tsunami evacuation. These results are given for each of the four different communities.

95

Chapter 5 Wainui

2006 National Coastal survey

The majority (38%) of Wainui residents said that they had not been given any advice on what to do during a tsunami evacuation. 4% had been told to have emergency supplies, 2% had been told to listen to the radio, 36% had been told to evacuate to high ground or inland following an earthquake, and 14% had been told to take some other action. Other actions included not going down to the beach, and not driving. Westshore 6.6% of Westshore residents said that they had been told to have emergency supplies, 17.1% had been told to evacuate to high ground or inland following an earthquake, 5.3% had been told to listen to the radio, and 14.5% had been given some other form of advice. Other advice included reading instructions in the back of the telephone book, driving to the nearest high point, moving at least 1km inland or 35m above sea level, not going sigh seeing. The majority (61.8%) of Westshore residents however said that they had not been given any advice. Haumoana The majority (51.2%) of Haumoana residents had not been given any advice on what to do during a tsunami evacuation. 9.8% had been told to have emergency supplies, 31.7% had been told to evacuate to high ground or inland following an earthquake, 4.9% had been told to listen to the radio, and 12.2% had been given another form of advice. Other advice included keeping away from the sea and rivers, moving 1-2km inland, leaving a note in the window saying that they had evacuated, and to respect the ocean and be prepared for the worst. Te Awanga 13.2% of Te Awanga residents had been told to have emergency supplies, 34.2% had been told to move inland or to high ground following an earthquake, 2.6% had been told to listen to the radio, and 5.3% had been given some other form of advice. Other advice included not going to the beach, and not to panic. 50% of Te Awanga residents had not been given any advice on what to do during a tsunami evacuation. It is interesting to note that overall the majority (51.7%) of residents from all of the four communities surveyed said that they had not been given any advice on what to do during a tsunami evacuation. This is something that needs to be addressed by the relevant CDEM groups.

Chapter 5 Child's school disaster preparedness plan

2006 National Coastal survey

Those residents who have school aged children were asked whether their child's school has a disaster preparedness plan that includes tsunamis. 49 residents responded to this question, with 26.5% saying yes, 16.3% saying no, and 57.1% saying they did not know if their child's school has a preparedness plan that includes tsunamis.

Child's school disaster preparedness plan- extent of agreement Respondents with school aged children were asked to indicate to which extent they agree or disagree with the following statements.

Allow child to remain at school when a tsunami warning is issued When asked to which extent they agreed or disagreed that they would allow their child to remain at school when a disaster warning is issued 25.5% of respondents strongly disagreed with the statement, 6.4% disagreed, 21.3% said maybe, 14.9% agreed, and 31.9% strongly agreed.

Will go and get child from school when a tsunami warning is issued The majority (42.6%) of residents strongly agreed that they would go and get their child from school when a tsunami warning was issued. 14.9% agreed with the statement, 19.1% said maybe, 6.4% disagreed, and 10.6% strongly disagreed. 6.4% said that this does not apply.

Will trust the schools tsunami plan to protect their child 15.2% of residents strongly disagreed with the statement that they would trust the schools tsunami plan to protect their child during a tsunami event, 4.3% disagreed, 10.9% said maybe, 26.1% agreed, and 37% strongly agreed. 6.5% said that this does not apply.

COMPARISON BETWEEN 2003 AND 2006 COASTAL SURVEYS

There are a number of questions that were asked in both the 2003 National Coastal survey and the 2006 National Coastal survey. This section compares these results, and discusses how peoples' perceptions may have changed following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Results from the 2003 survey were obtained from Johnston et al, 2003.

Last tsunami that affected this area There is a noticeable difference between results of the 2003 and 2006 coastal surveys (Figure 5.17) in relation to when residents thought that the last tsunami that affected their area occurred. The percentage of residents who did not know when the last tsunami affected their area had decreased markedly between 2003 and 2006, and the percentage who said they thought the last tsunami had occurred in the last 100 years had increased between the 2003 and the 2006 surveys for all communities except for Westshore where there was found to be a slight decrease from 2003 to 2006.. 101

Hazard zone maps Between 2003 and 2006 there has been a noticeable increase in residents from each community who have seen tsunami hazard zone maps for their area (Figure 5.18). There has also been a decrease in the number of residents who said that they are unsure if they have seen tsunami hazard zone maps (Figure 5.19), and residents who said that they have not seen tsunami hazard zone maps for their community (Figure 5.20).

Chapter 5 New Zealand public tsunami warning system

2006 National Coastal survey

There was a noticeable decrease from 2003 to 2006 in the number of respondents who said that they did not know what the New Zealand public tsunami warning system consists of (Wainui: 32% in 2003 to 8% in 2006; Westshore: 23.8% in 2003 to 7.9% in 2006; Haumoana: 38.8% in 2003 to 14.6% in 2006; and Te Awanga: 40.4% in 2003 to 5.3% in 2006). There was an increase in the awareness of respondents saying that the New Zealand public tsunami warning system consists of sirens and radio and TV announcements.

Who is responsible for issuing tsunami warnings From 2003 to 2006 there was a decrease in the number of respondents who said that they do not know who is responsible for issuing tsunami warnings of (Wainui: 25.8% in 2003 to 2% in 2006; Westshore: 17.5 in 2003 to 11.8% in 2006; Haumoana: 34.7% in 2003 to 24.4% in 2006; and Te Awanga: 24.6% in 2003 to 5.3% in 2006). There has been an increase in those respondents who think that Central Government and their Regional Council is responsible for issuing warnings.

Time to move to safety following a tsunami warning It was encouraging to note that between the 2003 National coastal survey and the 2006 resurvey of these communities there was a decrease in the number of respondents who said that they did not know how much time they would have to move to safety following a tsunami warning (Wainui: 44.2% in 2003 to 32% in 2006; Westshore: 37.1% in 2003 to 32.9% in 2006; Haumoana: 40.8% in 2003 to 39% in 2006; and Te Awanga: 50% in 2003 to 34.2% in 2006). There was also an overall decrease in the number of residents who said that they would have only a few minutes to move to safety following a tsunami warning, and an overall decrease in the number of residents who said that they would have between 10 minutes and half an hour to move to safety. There was also a general decrease in the number of residents who said that they would have 1-2 hours to move to safety following a tsunami, except at Westshore where there was an increase in the number of respondents who thought that they would have this amount of time to move to safety. There were inconsistencies in the time frame variables that were given in the 2003 and the 2006 surveys (the 2003 survey had the time frame option of more than 2 hours, while the 104

Chapter 5

2006 National Coastal survey

2006 survey had time frame options of 2-5 hours, and more than 5 hours) and it is therefore not possible to further make comparisons.

Time to move to safety from a possible tsunami if the respondent feels a strong earthquake while at the beach As with the previous question there was a decrease in the number of respondents who said that they did not know how much time they would have to move to safety from a possible tsunami if they felt a strong earthquake while at the beach (Wainui: 46.3% in 2003 to 32% in 2006; Westshore: 42.1% in 2003 to 31.6% in 2006; Haumoana: 50% in 2003 to 41.5% in 2006; and Te Awanga: 44.6% in 2003 to 31.6% in 2006). There was an increase in the number of respondents who said that they thought they would only have a few minutes, and an increase in the number of respondents who said they would have between 10 minutes and half an hour, and overall an increase in those who said they would have between half an hour and 1 hour to move to safety. There was a decrease in the number of respondents who said that they would have any more than 1 hour to move to safety.

Heard or received information on preparing for tsunamis There was an overall increase in the number of respondents who had heard or received information on preparing for tsunamis from the 2003 to the 2006 surveys. This increase is especially noticeable for those saying they heard or received information on tsunamis from Central Government Agencies (Wainui: 6.2.% in 2003 to 10% in 2006; Westshore: 4% in 2003 to 11.8% in 2006; Haumoana: 2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2006; and Te Awanga: 5.3% in 2003 to 28.9% in 2006), the Regional Council (Wainui:11.3.% in 2003 to 22% in 2006; Westshore: 7.9% in 2003 to 25% in 2006; Haumoana: 4.1% in 2003 to 17.1% in 2006; and Te Awanga: 8.8% in 2003 to 28.9% in 2006), and Civil Defence (Wainui: 33% in 2003 to 60% in 2006; Westshore: 27.8% in 2003 to 31.6% in 2006; Haumoana: 6.1% in 2003 to 29.3% in 2006; and Te Awanga: 21.1% in 2003 to 34.2% in 2006).

Asked for information on how to get ready for tsunami hazards Very few respondents from either the 2003 or 2006 surveys had asked anyone for information on how to get ready for tsunami hazards, however there was a slight 105

Chapter 5

2006 National Coastal survey

decrease between the 2003 and the 2006 surveys in the percentage of respondents who said that they had not asked anyone for information (Wainui: 88.7% in 2003 to 52.1% in 2006; Westshore: 79.4% in 2003 to 78.9% in 2006; Haumoana: 85.7% in 2003 to 75.6% in 2006; and Te Awanga: 93% in 2003 to 76.3% in 2006). This possibly indicates that the New Zealand public are becoming more aware of the risk that tsunami pose to coastal communities. However, it is also likely that those who have had previous tsunami experience (e.g. the Tongan earthquake and consequent tsunami warning for Gisborne and Hawke's Bay in May 2006) are more likely to have sought information since this incident. Findings from a survey conducted following the tsunami warning in May 2006 have shown that Gisborne residents were more aware of the possible tsunami than Hawke's Bay residents (see Chapter 2), and this may explain why a smaller percentage of Wainui residents have not sought information on tsunami than Hawke's Bay residents, and why there is such a noticeable decrease from 2006 to 2003 in the number of residents who said they had not asked anyone for information.

Seek information on tsunami hazards There was an overall increase between 2003 and 2006 of residents who said that they would in the next month or so after completing the survey seek information on tsunami hazards.

Seek information on responding to tsunami hazards There was an increase in the percentage of respondents who said that in the next month or so after completing the survey they would seek information on how to respond to tsunamis.

Become involved with a local group to discuss how to reduce tsunami risks Between 2003 and 2006 there was a noticeable increase in the number of respondents who said that they would become involved in a local group to discuss how to reduce tsunami risks.

Chapter 5 5.5 DISCUSSION

2006 National Coastal survey

Webb (2005) found that there was complacency and a limited understanding of tsunami risk evident amongst residents in coastal communities around New Zealand. It appears that this is still the case. This limited understanding and complacency is partly due to the fact that there has been a relatively calm period from tsunami since the last damaging tsunami which occurred in May 1960 (Webb, 2005). Devastating events can often increase a persons' awareness and perception of risk, however, as Johnston et al (Submitted) speculate, perception of risk often diminishes over a period in which no hazards occur.

In New Zealand, it is the responsibility of MCDEM and Regional Councils to mitigate the effects of natural hazard events (de Lange, 2003). However, in order to develop effective risk management measures we need to have a better understanding of experience in dealing with significant tsunami at an individual, community, and national level (Webb, 2005). In 2003 a national coastal community survey was conducted at 42 communities around New Zealand with the aim of identifying residents and visitors perceptions of, and preparedness for coastal hazards (Johnston et al, 2003; Webb, 2005). Following the devastating 2004 Boxing Day tsunami it was decided to resurvey residents in order to determine how peoples' perceptions of, and knowledge of tsunami risk may have changed.

Tsunami generating earthquakes are relatively rare (between 1861 and 1948 only 124 tsunami were recorded from a total of 15 000 earthquakes) (Bryant, 2005). However, earthquakes are the most common cause of tsunami (Dudley and Lee, 1988; de Lange, 2003). Knowledge of the most common cause of tsunamis was high amongst respondents of the 2006 national coastal resurvey, with the majority of respondents understanding that earthquakes are the most frequent cause. It is somewhat disturbing however to note that there are still a number of residents who either do not know what the most frequent cause of a tsunami is, or who believe that high tides, or hurricanes/storms are responsible.

107

Chapter 5

2006 National Coastal survey

The 2006 national coastal survey found that awareness of tsunami risk in New Zealand was still relatively low, although this has increased somewhat since the 2003 National Coastal Survey. In saying this however, it must be noted that residents of Wainui have a very good awareness of when the last tsunami affected their area in comparison with the other communities surveyed.

The majority of respondents believed that the next tsunami could occur at some stage within the next 100 years. It was noted however, that a number of respondents (24.4%) answered that they did not know when the next tsunami might occur. How people perceive risk is an important factor into how well they well prepare for, and respond in the event of a hazard (Peacock et al, 2005). Thus, it is important to ascertain public risk perception in order for authorities to make the most effective decisions in relation to natural hazard events. Perception of risk is also positively related to how people will respond to warnings (Peacock et al, 2005).

It was encouraging to note that the majority of respondents surveyed said that they would move inland or to high ground in the event of a tsunami warning being issued, or in the event of a possible local source tsunami occurring. This was consistent in both the 2003 and the 2006 surveys. It is disappointing however, that very few said that they would take emergency supplies with them. In the event of a disaster people may need to evacuate for extended periods of time - possibly over 24 hours (Johnston, D.M. 2007, pers. comm., 18 February), therefore, it is vital that people take emergency supplies with them when evacuating from their homes. The majority of respondents did not know how much time they would have to move to safety in the event of a distant source tsunami warning being issued. However, all respondents said that they would have less than an hour to move to safety in the event of a possible local source tsunami. In New Zealand there are only warning systems in place for distant source tsunami, as there will generally not be adequate time to issue a warning in the instance of a local source tsunami being generated (Webb, 2005). It is important therefore to ensure that the public receive effective and continuous education into public warnings (both human generated warnings and natural warnings) in order to ensure we have tsunami ready communities (Darienzo et al, 2005). Local populations need to be aware of the signs of an approaching local 108

Chapter 5

2006 National Coastal survey

source tsunami in order to be able to take the correct actions without relying on directions from officials (Dengler, 2005).

Education is an important tool for ensuring that the public are aware of the risk associated with natural hazards, and evidence suggests that public response to warnings will increase if well designed public education initiatives are undertaken (Leonard et al, 2006). Since the early 1990s, Washington State, USA has undertaken considerable tsunami hazard assessments, along with tsunami warning and mitigation efforts. A number of products for communicating tsunami risk to the public such as tsunami brochures, evacuation maps, posters, and a tsunami school education program have been developed. These products have all been successful in increasing awareness about tsunami hazard amongst coastal Washington residents. However, levels of preparedness were still found to be low to moderate amongst residents. These findings show the need for use of additional strategies to help improve public preparedness (Crawford, 2006). Paton et al, (2004) also found that the effectiveness of public education strategies which are based entirely on providing information to the public are questionable, and recommended the need for greater community engagement and empowerment in emergency management planning.

Preparedness activities can help to reduce the risk of injury and damage, and can help to facilitate a capability for coping with disruption associated with the hazard (Paton, 2003). Preparedness for tsunamis was found to be low amongst residents of the 2006 national coastal survey with the majority of residents indicating that they are not becoming tsunami prepared. The majority in high risk areas do not have a backpack filled with emergency supplies, less than half said they were developing a family response plan, and almost no one had participated in either an official, or an unofficial tsunami evacuation drill. It is also disappointing to note that the majority of residents had not asked for any information on how to get ready for a tsunami hazard, although it should be noted that there has been an increase between the 2003 survey and the 2006 survey in the number of residents who had asked for information. It is possible that the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami influenced this increase, as the majority of residents said that the Boxing Day 2004 tsunami had influenced their willingness to prepare for tsunami hazards. It is also possible that the tsunami warning for the east 109

Chapter 5

2006 National Coastal survey

coast of New Zealand following the Tongan earthquake on 4 May 2006 contributed to this increase. However, although a persons' risk perception can be influenced by personal experience with a hazard, this does not necessarily lead to better preparedness (Johnston et al, 1999). This is backed up by the findings that preparedness for tsunamis is low on the east coast of New Zealand, even though both Hawke's Bay and Gisborne experienced the false tsunami warning in May 2006.

Understanding of tsunami hazards does not appear very high in any of the communities surveyed. It is possible that sufficient information on tsunamis is not available to the public. Findings from this survey have shown that although the majority of residents surveyed in the 2006 coastal survey indicated that they did live in a tsunami inundation zone, when asked if they had seen any tsunami hazard zone maps for their area the majority of residents had not. Only the Wainui community had more than half of the residents answering that they had seen tsunami hazard zone maps. Also one third of all residents surveyed said that they had not heard or received any information on tsunamis from any source, and the vast majority of residents indicated that they did not know if there were tsunami evacuation routes in place in their community. This causes some concern, as although Paton et al (2004) speculate that the effectiveness of public education that is based solely on providing information to the public is questionable, it would be preferable for more residents to have been provided with adequate information on preparing for tsunamis, tsunami hazard zone maps, and tsunami evacuation procedures and routes.

Summary and Recommendations

Chapter Six SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Chapter 6 6.1 INTRODUCTION

Summary and Recommendations

This study has examined community understanding of, and preparedness for tsunami hazard in the eastern North Island, New Zealand. Several questions were asked in Chapter 1 before embarking on this research in order to better understand community perception, understanding, and preparedness for tsunami risk in New Zealand. These questions were: · · · · · Does the public have sufficient knowledge of tsunami hazards in their community? Is there adequate information on tsunamis available to the public? Does the public have an understanding of tsunami warnings - both natural warnings and human generated warning systems? Is the public aware of the correct actions to take in the event of a tsunami warning being issued? How prepared are staff in hotels/motels for dealing with natural hazards in the Hawke's Bay tourism sector?

These questions can be used to summarise the major findings of this study.

6.2

MAJOR FINDINGS

The findings of community understanding and preparedness for tsunami risk in the eastern North Island are as follows: ·

The general public has limited knowledge of tsunami risk in their area. Hawke's Bay residents and visitors to camping grounds in Hawke's Bay appear to have a lower understanding of tsunami risk in the area than do residents in the Gisborne area.

·

There does not appear to be adequate information on tsunamis available to the public. The majority of residents surveyed in the 2006 National Coastal Survey had not seen any information on tsunami evacuation routes for their 111

Chapter 6

Summary and Recommendations

area, and only one third of residents had heard or received any information on tsunamis from any source. Less than one third of respondents surveyed at the camping grounds in Hawke's Bay had heard or received any information on tsunamis. ·

Understanding of the official tsunami warning system was higher amongst residents surveyed in the 2006 National Coastal Survey than visitors surveyed in the camping grounds. The majority of camping ground survey respondents indicated that they do not know what makes up the local public notification system.

·

Understanding of the natural signs of a tsunami, or signs that a tsunami may have been generated was high amongst respondents surveyed in the camping grounds. The majority of respondents indicated that they believe receding water is a natural sign of a tsunami. This question was not asked in the 2006 National Coastal Survey. Therefore, no comparison can be made between the two surveys.

·

Overall, the public are aware of the correct actions to take in the event of a tsunami warning being issued. The majority of respondents surveyed in the camping ground survey, and the majority of respondents surveyed in the 2006 National Coastal Survey indicated that in the event of a tsunami warning they would move either to high ground or inland. However, very few respondents in either survey said that they would take supplies with them.

·

Staff in hotels/motels in the Napier area were not well prepared for managing natural hazard events. The majority of respondents had not received any training for dealing with emergencies, and none of those who had received training had received training for tsunami hazards. However, for the majority of respondents who had received some training for emergencies, this training was not ongoing, and there was also no consistency in how this training was delivered, or in the regularity of it.

112

Chapter 6 ·

Summary and Recommendations

Just over half of those surveyed said that their establishment conducted exercises or drills. However, none of the establishments conducted exercises/drills for tsunamis. The timing of how often these exercises/drills were conducted also varied between once a month and once every 12 months.

·

Although it was found that almost all of the establishments surveyed did have hazard signage in place, and these signs were located in all of the rooms/units, it was found that only one of the establishments had hazard signage that indicated what to do in the event of a tsunami.

6.3

RECOMMENDATIONS

The findings of this study suggest that several recommendations be made in order to ensure that coastal communities are better prepared in the event of a tsunami event. These are as follows:

The public need to be provided with more information on tsunami in their local area. This includes: 1) specific area at risk; 2) what types of warnings may be issued; 3) who will be issuing them; 4) what specific actions should be taken upon receipt of a warning (e.g. what to take, where to go, what route(s) to follow). This may be in the form of pamphlets, educational workshops, tsunami evacuation route information, or media coverage.

Workshops need to be conducted by emergency managers with staff from tourist establishments (including camping grounds) in Hawke's Bay to determine knowledge of natural hazard events, and provide information on how hazard events can be better managed.

The suggested actions, described above, need to be part of a longer-term strategy to develop tsunami resilient communities. This will require not only public education but a range of activities that engage, empower and motivate at-risk communities to respond effectively and appropriately to tsunami warnings.
