Demography of nineteenth century New Zealand education: gender and regional differences in school retention
C. Hodder

Abstract
This thesis examines the progress of pupils through New Zealand schools in the last two decades of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century. The purpose of this study was to apply demographic techniques to primary historical education data to enable the progress of pupils to be quantified and to allow comparisons to be made among different Education Districts and longitudinally over a period of some three decades.

The present work applies demographic methods using cohort and period analyses to overcome difficulties in direct comparisons of historical education data because of differences in population structure and differing examination pass rates in various Education Districts. This approach allows the determination of retention rates of pupils both by age and by level from Standard 4 to Standard 6 using primary data from the nineteenth century. In addition, gender differences in retention by age are analysed from the 1880s to the end of the first decade of the twentieth century. Previous published work considered school attendance only in general terms and usually on a national basis, but generally without analysing specific educational data on gender differences.

Studies prior to the present work have suggested that in the nineteenth century Education Districts differed in school enrolments (Hodder, 1996) and it is thus likely that there were differences in school retention of pupils between various Education Districts. Pilot research to the present work developed demographic methods for studying retention of pupil populations allowing for changes in the number and structure of the pupils populations over time (Hodder, 2005). These pilot methods are applied in the present research to study pupil retention in all thirteen Education Districts over the approximately 30 years from the 1880s. In addition to age and level

cohorts, gender differences are analysed. Direct comparisons among all Education Districts and over time are now possible.

This study has used a novel approach to the analysis of historical education data. The results enable comparisons to be made among all thirteen Education Districts and across several decades; such comparisons have not previously been possible and will facilitate future research on the possible factors affecting pupil retention particularly in relation to employment opportunities for school leavers and differences according to gender. __________

Preface
Rationale, significance and limitations of this work This work sets out to use a demographic methodology, developed in an earlier pilot study, and apply this methodology to historical education data which has not previously been analysed in a comprehensive fashion using any methodology. The application of a demographic methodology to such historical education data has, to my knowledge, never been attempted before, certainly not for New Zealand data.

The principal aim of this thesis was to analyse a complete set of data for all the thirteen Education Districts in New Zealand for the last two decades of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century. The thesis set out to detect trends and patterns in pupil attendance and retention in the primary schools. Retention and attendance were considered in relation to age, gender and education level (Standard level). Restrictions on the size of the thesis prevented further detailed examination of these trends. It is envisaged that further research, based on the findings presented here, would allow the explanation of the trends in relation to broader issues such as employment patterns as well as changes in society, such as the rise in what has been termed the "cult of domesticity", around the beginning of the twentieth century. Such research could not be carried out in this thesis because of the limits placed on the size of the thesis.

It is recognised that in some of the analyses, the results for the genders are reciprocal. For completeness and to assist future research, the graphs and tables for both males and females have been included, as this will allow other workers to interpret the data from this thesis without the need to recalculate data from the primary sources.

Chapter 1 Introduction

Chapter 1 Introduction
Preliminary studies have shown that there are noticeable differences in schooling and school attendance behaviour in various Education Districts in New Zealand in the nineteenth century (Hodder, 1995). Such differences have not been reported or studied in detail and in a systematic way in the research literature. Rather, generalised statements have usually been made which refer mostly to schooling in the whole country and throughout much of the nineteenth century without being more specific as to location or time. Such general statements are frequently made without reference to raw data; for example, claims relating to an overall increase in the number of pupils attending school and Butchers' "river of education" thesis (Butchers, 1930, p. vii).

This thesis sets out to investigate in a systematic way some of the differences between the Education Districts in pupils attending government schools from 1880 until the end of the first decade of the twentieth century. In the research literature, regional variations in schooling and school attendance are only available in a piecemeal way with large parts of the country being unresearched. Some information is sometimes found in histories of individual schools (e.g., Cambridge Primary School ­ see Hodder, 1996) or in works dealing with regional administration such as Education Board histories (e.g., Cumming, 1959; Matthews, 1988).

In the published literature the histories of education in New Zealand fall into two main types: the traditional histories which focus on increasing school attendance and are linked to attendance legislation changes, and revisionist histories which maintain that school attendance was driven by employment and society and by credentialing rather than by attendance legislation which only followed what was already happening.

The literature on school attendance, particularly for the nineteenth century, is often contradictory and usually has few data to back claims. There are often sweeping generalisations and these are mostly for the whole nation although there are some exceptions. For example, McKenzie (1982) provides the reader with data and contains some regional comments. In addition, comments on gender differences, particularly relating to school attendance, are also often generalisations; again few data are offered

3 for consideration and such data as are given are often selective and conflicting. O'Neill (1992, p. 76) notes the "omission of considerations of gender from educational research" and Openshaw, Lee, & Lee (1993, p. 255) note that until recently "many New Zealand historians of education subordinated gender to their principal aim of describing the growth and progress of state education" and these authors point out the need for more researchers to become aware of the experiences of females in education (p. 266).

All previous published work, including those that analyse data, have used official returns from the Department of Education and published in the Appendices to the Journals of the House of Representatives. No published work has attempted to follow individual cohorts of pupils to determine changes in attendance for a cohort over time, to compare individual cohorts, and to compare regional differences for cohorts. The use of cohorts allows changes in attendance (for whatever reason) to be tracked longitudinally through the last two decades of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century. It also allows some investigation of gender differences in school retention related to age. While this analysis is somewhat crude, it is the first attempt to study gender differences with age in various cohorts in a systematic way throughout all the Education Districts allowing direct comparisons. As McKenzie (1982, p. 9) notes, material from the data from the Department of Education has often remained "unread and criticised". The present work attempts to shed some light on these data.

Campbell (quoted by McKenzie, 1982, p. 24) "makes an intelligent guess" about jobs requiring increasingly higher qualifications but this, according to McKenzie, remains an unresearched area. The present thesis sets the scene regionally to allow a full analysis throughout all regions of New Zealand which in the future will allow researchers to test the possible linkage between educational qualifications and employment.

Historical
In New Zealand in the nineteenth century there were marked differences in regional populations, especially in the number of people (population density) and the makeup

4 of regional populations (such as age and gender makeup) (Gibson, 1972, pp. 34-35, pp. 94-95). Thus it is difficult to compare accurately schooling in different regions to detect real regional differences and to perhaps detect national trends where all or most regions show similar changes or trends. Previous work developed a methodology to overcome some of the major issues relating to population variability (Hodder, 2005). The methods allow the comparison of school attendance and retention in regions with different populations and to study changes over time. These methods will be applied in the present thesis. The data to be used in the present research have been available for a long time but have never been analysed in the systematic way that is set out in this study. Although in the education literature there have been some comments about the topic covered in the present work, no detailed and systematic analyses have been carried out particularly considering regional variations and gender differences for the various Education Districts over a period of some thirty years.

The Education Act of 1877 is regarded historically as the pivotal point in the history of New Zealand education and is considered to still influence education in New Zealand at the beginning of the twenty first century. This Act has been widely studied and analysed (e.g., Butchers, 1930; Mackey, 1967; Ewing, 1970) but none of these earlier studies have analysed school attendance by age and by Standard level using cohorts of pupils over such a long period of time and for individual Education Districts. This thesis analyses data for thirteen individual Education Districts separately and compares the findings among the various Education Districts.

The period 1880 to 1910 was selected because this is the time when public education in New Zealand was almost exclusively at the primary level, with some public secondary education beginning to be provided from the first decade of the twentieth century. During this period about 75% of the population aged 5-15 years was being educated at Government primary schools (although the percentage for females was consistently about 3% below that of males) (data from 1906 Census) and the literacy rate of the population over 5 y increased from 85% in 1881 to 94% in 1911 (Bloomfield, 1984, p.111). The present study starts with data from 1880 when the Education Act of 1877 was fully operational, having come into force on 1 January

5 1878; however, because of the low density of the population and the isolated nature of many communities, it was some time before the requirements of the Education Act were fully effective.

The end of the study coincides with the 1910 Education Amendment Act which for the first time made school attendance compulsory for all pupils between the ages of 7 years and 14 years on all occasions when the school was open.

Data for the Standard level at which pupils were studying were available only from 1880 to 1904 in comparable form. After 1904, data on Standard pass rates were no longer provided and thus after 1904 the retention of pupils in cohorts through successive Standards could not be calculated in a manner comparable with the calculations used for earlier data.

Background
Education Districts and Education Boards In total, twelve Education Districts were set up under the 1877 Education Act (see Figs 1, 2, 3); each Education District was made up of specified counties (see Table 1); counties and boroughs had been set up in 1876 under the Counties Act.

Each Education District was controlled and administered by an Education Board usually located in a main centre and usually far removed from the small local schools. The Education Districts set up by the 1877 Education Act mostly followed the boundaries of the provincial areas that had been abolished when the provinces were dismantled in 1876 (King, 2003, p. 232). Many of the members of the newly constituted Education Boards had previously been members of the Provincial Education Boards and so it is not surprising that the new Education Boards continued along mostly the same lines as the earlier Provincial Education Boards although these Boards were now responsible to the central Department of Education. This Department, however, was a new entity established by the 1877 Education Act and had few resources (Butchers, 1930, p. 39). Thus the Education Boards were able to assume more powers and responsibilities than may have been originally envisaged,

and they became very powerful bodies controlling many aspects of the education system within their District. The financial position of the various Education Boards varied considerably. Some Boards had more than sufficient funds and even had large surpluses from endowments dating back to Provincial times (for example, Canterbury and Otago; Cumming, 1959 p. 129). Other Boards without such endowment provisions were totally reliant on

10 funding from central government in the form of capitation grants. When the 1877 Education Act came into force a national education system was born and along with this was the need to fund education on a national basis. The new scheme was set up to pay a statutory capitation amount for each child attending government schools. The capitation grant was initially set at 3 pounds 15 shillings (£3 15s) per pupil in average attendance with the money being paid to the Education Boards who then distributed the funds to the School Committees.

An Order in Council in May 1878 (New Zealand Gazette, 30 May 1878, pp. 694-695) spelt out in detail the methods for calculating the average attendance for each school. There were two types of average attendance - the strict average and the working average. Strict average was calculated as: a+ p f +n

where: a = the number of morning attendances p = the number of afternoon attendances f = the number of times the school was open in the morning during the period under consideration n = the number of times the school was open during the afternoon during the period under consideration. The working average was calculated as: a+ p ( d - b) + (e - c )

where: a = the number of morning attendances p = the number of afternoon attendances b = the number of times the school was open in the morning where number attending was less than half the number on the roll c = the number of times the school was open in the afternoon where number attending was less than half the number on the roll d = the number of times the school was open during the morning during the period under consideration e = the number of times the school was open during the afternoon during the period under consideration. Thus the main difference between the two averages was that for the working average the days on which attendance was less than half the number of pupils on the roll were ignored (Ewing, 1970, p. 34).

11 Comparing these two forms of calculating the average attendances, even small differences in attendance could result in quite large variations in the calculations and thus in the money available to the school. For example, if a school had a roll of 100 pupils and was open for 40 half-days in a month (20 morning sessions and 20 afternoon sessions), and if 80 pupils attended every morning and 70 pupils attended every afternoon, the strict average attendance would have been:
(80 pupils x 20 mornings open) + (70 pupils x 20 afternoons open) = 75 pupils 20 mornings open + 20 afternoons open

If fewer than one-half of the pupils on the roll (say 45 pupils out of 100) attended on 3 mornings and on 4 afternoons in the month, then the working average attendance would have been:
((80 pupils x 17 mornings) + (45 pupils x 3 mornings)) + ((70 pupils x 16 afternoons) + (4 pupils x 45 afternoons)) (20 mornings open) - (3 mornings with <half roll)) + ((20 afternoons open) - (4 afternoons with <half roll)) = (1360 + 135) + (1120 + 180) = 84.7 pupils 17 + 16

Thus with these different methods of calculating the average attendance there is a difference of about 9 pupils which, at a capitation rate of £3 15s per pupil per year, would mean a difference of £2 16s 3d income for the school in one month or an annual difference of £33 15s. This is a reasonably substantial sum of money when it is compared, for example, to the annual salary of only £30 that many female pupil teachers received at the time. So the extra money would have been enough to employ an additional pupil teacher for a year.

Thus for many Education Boards the number of pupils attending schools regularly was of critical importance for financial reasons. Cumming & Cumming (1978, p. 101) note that in the late 1880s some Education Boards were urging the abolition of the strict average calculation in favour of the working average because of the disparity of funding resulting from these two methods. The Boards noted that the number of pupils actually attending was often reduced because of circumstances over which the Boards and teachers had no control; for example bad weather, bad roads, swollen creeks, illness epidemics, and so on.

12 Compulsory school attendance legislation and regulations The Education Act of 1877, which came into force on 1 January 1878, set out for the first time in New Zealand a national education system which was to be free, secular and compulsory. Among the various aspects of the legislation, children between the ages of 7 and 13 years were required to be attending a recognised school or to be being adequately educated at home. Those attending government schools were required to attend for at least one half of the period each year when the school was open. Those children who had passed Standard 4 could be exempted from attending (irrespective of their age) as could those who had reached their thirteenth birthday (irrespective of the level they had reached).

Individual schools were administered by a local school committee made up of annually-elected local householders. The school committee controlled many aspects of the school including the implementing (or otherwise) of the compulsory attendance regulations.

The enforcement of the compulsory attendance clause of the 1877 Education Act was in the hands of the local school committee which could choose not to enforce it. Some school committees enforced the clause immediately while others were still debating the issue some 10 years after the Act was passed (Hodder, 1996, p. 105). In fact, the compulsory clause of the Act was often laxly enforced perhaps because the members of school committees were reluctant to take action against their neighbours or even against one of their own members (Campbell, 1941, p. 89).

The Education Act was amended with the 1885 Education Amendment Act which came into force on 1 January 1886. It required attendance of children between the ages of 7 and 13 years who lived within 2 miles of a school by road, for 30 days each quarter; the level of exemption remained at Standard 4 and the age of exemption was 13 years (Table 2). It has been claimed that during the 1880s the majority of children, especially boys in the country districts, left school for good at the age of about twelve, after passing Standard 4 (Campbell, 1941, p. 90). An inspector in the 1880s noted the attainments of the average boy as follows:

13 He can read a passage of ordinary difficulty from a newspaper, not well, but intelligently; he can write a short letter on some simple subject in a legible hand, and probably without gross misspellings; and he knows enough of figures to be able to make out or check a tradesman's bill. As to the rest of his acquirements ... no apprehension need be felt that the scraps of geography, grammar and history that he may have picked up should be a serious obstacle to his success in life (quoted by Campbell, 1941, p. 90). A decade after the 1885 Education Amendment Act, the attendance requirements of pupils were again tightened with the 1894 School Attendance Act which required pupils' attendance for 6 times in any week when the school was open at least 9 times, each morning and afternoon session being counted separately. Note that school attendance was calculated in half-days and in effect this legislation still permitted pupils one and a half days away from school each week.

A Regulation published in 1899 raised the level of exemption to Standard 5 and two years later school attendance requirements were increased by the 1901 School Attendance Act which required children aged between 7 and 14 years to attend school two times less than the number of times the school was open per week.

Sources: Legislation and regulations published in official sources (New Zealand Statutes and New Zealand Gazette) * Exemption level is the Standard level at which a pupil can be exempted from attending school irrespective of age. The examination for the Standard of exemption must have been passed.

14 It was not until the passing of the Education Amendment Act of 1910 that all children between the ages of 7 and 14 years were required to attend school whenever the school was open (Butchers, 1930, p. 48).

Thus, although the 1877 Education Act set out to provide compulsory education for all children, it was over 30 years later that this became a reality. Until then there were always times when in fact children were permitted to be absent from school legitimately. The tightening of school attendance laws was seen by some as having little to do with educating young people and a lot to do with social control and reducing crime and delinquency (Jones, McCulloch, Marshall, Smith, & Smith, 1990, p. 34). In some cases the children who should have attended school were not able to do so because of inadequate or insufficient school accommodation (see Matthews, 1988, p. 19) especially during the depression of the 1880s when education funding cuts meant there was virtually no money available for extensions to and repair of school buildings.

It has been claimed that the 1901 School Attendance Act had a significant effect on school pupil numbers (Butchers, 1930, pp. 263-264) although the effect may well have been different in different Education Districts. There has been no research on regional differences in the effect of this legislation.

Conventional explanations (see Butchers, 1930; Ewing, 1970; Cumming & Cumming, 1978) claim that the rise in school enrolments and attendance after 1877 was the result of progressively stricter school attendance legislation. Some researchers (see McKenzie et al., 1996, p. 34), however, suggest that improvements in school attendance from 1877 up to 1920 have little direct relationship to the increasingly strict attendance laws. Rather, these authors suggest that the changes seen were related to prevailing social and economic circumstances at the time.

Chapter 2 Data and Methods Demographic methods
Period analysis Period analysis is a demographic method whereby changes in populations are analysed by comparing data for different times or time periods. Shryock & Siegel (1976, p. 550) note that "period data provide a current annual "picture" with respect to the event or characteristic under consideration". One of the main aspects of period analyses is to discriminate between changes that result from the composition or structure of a population and the cohort processes that are operating at that time in order to measure their respective impact on population change (Wunsch & Termote, 1978, p. 51). Observations for several cohorts recorded in a single year may be combined as if they were the observations of a single cohort recorded over several years. Such period aggregations are often referred to as "synthetic" or hypothetical cohorts. Thus synthetic cohorts are represented by period data combined in such a way as to reflect hypothetical experience over a span of years (Shryock & Siegel, 1976, p. 551) although the data are for a single year.

Cohort analysis A group of persons who experience a particular event during the same period of time is termed a cohort (Wunsch & Termote, 1978, p. 7). Also, a cohort is a group of persons with a common characteristic (Pol & Thomas, 1992, p. 134). Cohorts have also been defined as a group of individuals linked as a group in some way (Glenn, 1977, p. 5) and cohort analysis is a method of investigating the changes in patterns of behaviour or attitudes. Typically, cohort analysis refers to any study in which there are measures of some characteristic of one or more cohorts at two or more points in time (Glenn, 1977, p. 9). For some analyses cohorts will be constructed which will be real while others will be synthetic or hypothetical. Age cohorts are identified by grouping together persons who were born within a single year or a certain range of years. Cohort analysis typically involves following a cohort over time and can be used to measure the change in number and proportion of persons in various age groupings over time and cohort-to-cohort comparisons allow the assessment of change in cohort behaviour over time (Pol & Thomas, 1992, p. 134).

17 In the present study, two types of cohorts will be considered: firstly age cohorts in which pupils of the same age or in the same age group will be followed over time, and secondly pupils who are at the same level of schooling (in the same `Standard') will be followed over successive years. The former cohorts are the types of cohorts referred to as real cohorts by Shryock & Siegel (1976, p. 551). The latter cohorts will be followed to successive levels of schooling (Standards) using comparisons of expected and observed numbers of pupils at particular levels.

In the present study cohorts of pupils in successive school levels are constructed using recorded pupil numbers and pass and fail rates for various levels at the annual examinations. The calculated expected number of pupils and the actual observed number of pupils in the following year are then compared. The calculated expected number of pupils is not necessarily made up of the same pupils as those actually found in the initial cohort, and they may not be the same as those in the cohort of the next level in the following year. To ensure there is no confusion, in this study the term constructed cohort is used for Standard level cohorts of pupils that are tracked over a number of Standard levels.

Shryock & Siegel (1976, p. 553) note that cohort analysis has been applied to the study of educational progression after entry into school but the data used for such analysis has generally been contemporary data from the middle of the twentieth century or later (Shryock & Siegel, 1976, p. 180). School progression is usually not dependent on passing an annual examination but is dependent on moving to successive level principally based on age. The present work aims to apply a similar cohort analysis method to historical education data from the nineteenth century which have not previously been analysed.

Data were collected from the Appendix Tables attached to the Annual Reports of the Minister of Education (usually E-1 Reports) published in the Appendices to the Journals of the House of Representatives for the last 20 years of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century (1880 ­ 1911). In some cases data were not available for this complete range of dates; this is indicated where appropriate.

18 All data for the 13 Education Districts over the 30 years under consideration were gathered from the original nineteenth century primary sources. These data were then manually grouped as needed and manually entered into electronic databases. Most of the calculations were carried out manually with some simple calculations carried out electronically. The manual and electronic calculations were then used to produce the graphics to show trends over time; these graphics were used in interpretations of the results of the investigation.

(a) School retention - age Department of Education Annual Reports' Appendix Tables (published in the Appendices to the Journals of the House of Representatives as, usually, E-1 Reports) give the yearly number of pupils "on the books" of government primary schools in the last quarter of each school year in the various Education Districts. Information on the age of pupils was used to calculate the proportions of pupils in the various age groups and an attempt was made to track pupils in individual cohorts from the 7-9 y cohort for up to 6 years to try and determine when pupils left the education system. This was done by comparing the number of pupils in various age groups as proportions of the most stable age group (the 7-9 y group). Males and females were considered separately to try and determine if there are gender differences in the age of attendance. By using proportions related to a stable group within the population, the effects of changing population numbers can be minimised. Calculations were carried out for a number of separate cohorts over the 30-year period under consideration.

(b) School retention - level Department of Education Annual Reports also give yearly data on the level of education of pupils on the rolls of government primary schools (the `Standard' at which pupils were studying). Using these figures, a method was devised to try and determine at what Standard level the pupils leave the education system. This was done by starting with the pupils at one level (Standard) and constructing synthetic cohorts (termed constructed cohorts in this study) to try and track these pupils through the succeeding Standards into the post-compulsory levels of schooling (Standard 5 and Standard 6 in particular). The numbers of pupils actually observed in these higher Standards were compared to the expected (calculated) number of pupils in those same Standards over a period of about 20 years (as calculated from synthetic constructed

19 cohort estimates). Any changes over time that are detected will allow future research to relate education with the economic fortunes of a region including the employment prospects of school leavers.

Education data
Education data are available for each year from 1878 and are published in the Education Minister's Annual Report in the Appendices to the Journals of the House of Representatives. The data on pupil attendances at government primary schools and the level of schooling of the pupils are given separately for each of the twelve (later thirteen) Education Districts. These Education Districts were set up under the Education Act of 1877 and are detailed in the Second Schedule of that Act. Initially twelve Education Districts were established; in 1885 a new Education District of Grey was established by cutting off part of the Westland Education District.

The Education Act of 1877 details the counties that are to make up each Education District. Over time the number of counties increased and the boundaries of the counties as described above changed slightly; these changes have been taken into account in this study so, for example, the initial boundary of the Auckland Education District has been retained as originally set up under the Education Act of 1877 even though there have been changes to the counties included in this Education District allowing longitudinal comparisons of the educational data to be made. A map of the original counties of 1876 was used to draw the boundaries of the original Education Districts using the listing of counties from the census of 1881. Later censuses contained additional counties and the relationship of these to the original counties and also the boundaries of the various Education Districts were determined using a later map of counties' boundaries (dated 1957). Maps of the boundaries of the various Education Districts were constructed manually as none were available which detailed the counties included in all the Education Districts. Maps based on the original 1876 counties and those based on the 1957 counties were used to select the appropriate counties that form the thirteen Education Districts when gathering data from censuses in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Age distribution of pupils at government primary schools
Data used Data from the Annual Report of the Minster of Education, printed in the Appendices to the Journals of the House of Representatives, were collected manually and were compiled and amalgamated manually from these primary sources. The source tables of data list the ages of scholars on the books in government schools each Education District for the last quarter (or fourth quarter) of each year. The ages of the pupils are usually grouped into bands as follows: under 5 years, 5 and under 7 years, 7 and under 10 years, 10 and under 13 years, 13 and under 15 years, and over 15 years. In this work the demographic usage of age ranges is used. Thus the age band "5 and under 7 years" is recorded as "5-6 y"; the term "6 y" is used for children from the time they have passed their sixth birthday and until the day before they reach their seventh birthday. Occasionally data were provided in the source tables in smaller age bands such as 5 and under 6 years, 6 and under 7 years, 7 and under 8 years, etc.; in such cases the data were manually amalgamated into the age bands noted above to allow comparisons of data from various years. Pupils listed as "under 5 years" and those listed as "over 15 years" were manually removed from the pupil totals so only pupils aged between 5 and 15 years were considered. Data for males and females were considered separately and were also amalgamated manually as noted above.

In the last part of this study, individual age cohorts were tracked through the various age groups for each gender. The proportion of males and females in each age group was calculated and this proportion was compared with the gender proportions in the total school population. Since pupils were grouped into age bands, the proportions of pupils in the 7-9 y cohorts were compared to those in the 10-12 y cohort after three years, and these in turn were compared with those in the 13-14 y cohort three years later again. This is because the youngest pupils in the 7-9 y age group will take three years to move into the next age band at age 10 years; similarly it will take a pupil three years to move from the 10-12 y age group to the 13-14 y age group. While it is recognised that the oldest age group (13-14 y) covers only two years rather than the three years of other groups, the proportion of the genders should not be affected by this slightly smaller age range. Individual age cohorts starting at 5-year intervals were

21 tracked (starting in 1880, 1885, 1890, 1895, 1900 for age cohorts 7-9 y) and a total of six separate cohorts were analysed.

Methods Data printed in the tables in the Appendices to the Journals of the House of Representatives were collected manually and were regrouped manually to provide a continuous series of comparable age groups from 1880 to 1911. Figures for both males and females were available for the total time period being investigated.

The first part of this work used period analyses for each year to consider the proportion of the school pupils aged 5 to 15 years in various age groups over time and compared the proportions of males and females. While this method is a traditional demographic approach to such data it has not previously been used for this set of data or any similar historical education data and systematic gender comparisons of these data have not previously been reported in the literature.

The analyses in the second part of this work use the same data sets as for the first part of this work; ratios where one age group is related to another were calculated from the data sets. The use of ratios is not uncommon in such work. However, there have been no previous reports in the literature of the use of ratios to try and relate various school pupil age groups with each other. The use of ratios of younger and older school pupils with the same denominator (using the number of pupils in the middle age group as the denominator) is an attempt to determine in which age group the greatest changes in pupil numbers occurred over time. If the changes for the youngest age group can be deconvoluted from the changes in the older age groups this would allow a comparison of children entering schools with the birth rate in the population which was falling rapidly during the last two decades of the nineteenth century. Such a study has not previously been attempted and the present work will allow the first systematic gender comparisons over a 30-year period to be investigated. In addition, by deconvoluting the older age group from the younger ones, it may be possible to determine at what age pupils were actually leaving the schooling system. Previous writings on this subject have not been supported with actual yearly data. The present investigations would allow actual school leaving age to be related to legislation dealing with school

22 attendance and employment of younger workers, and overall employment prospects for males and females when they left school.

The third part of this work deals with age cohorts and attempts to track the proportions of pupils of individual age cohorts in various age groups over time and to make a first study of gender differences. The method of cohort analysis is a normal demographic technique but such an analysis has not previously been attempted using these data. The cohorts used are real in that the pupils in one age group will generally be the same pupils in the next age group after the appropriate number of years. This method does not, however, distinguish those pupils who move in and out of the region or Education District and thus the cohorts being studied should be labelled derived or synthetic cohorts. Changes in individual cohorts over time allow gender comparisons which in turn can lead to information about gender differences in the school leaving age. A detailed analysis of this topic has not previously been reported in the literature for this time period.

Throughout this study standard recognised demographic methods are applied to data from a previously unexplored source in a way that has not previously been reported in the literature. The analyses described above will allow further detailed investigations in areas of schooling and employment that have not previously been possible.

Level of schooling
Data used This work used education data from the Annual Reports of the Minister of Education which relate to the number of pupils on the rolls of the government schools in the fourth quarter of the school year for each year considered. Data were available for the period 1880 to 1904 and were collected manually from the primary source. In addition, the Education Minster's Report contained information on the pass rates for each Education District for pupils in each Standard. These pass rates were the pass rates for those pupils who were presented for examination for each Standard rather than the pass rates for all pupils in each Standard (not all pupils in a Standard were presented for examination for a variety of reasons). From these pass rates, the fail rates were manually calculated for each Standard for each year. Using the number of

23 pupils in each Standard and the pass/fail rates, it was possible to calculate the number of pupils expected in the next Standard the following year forming an expected cohort. Such cohorts were manually constructed to track pupils from Standard 3 through to Standard 6 with the expected numbers of pupils in each Standard being manually calculated. From the expected and observed numbers of pupils it was then possible to calculate the change in the difference between these two values, expressed as a percentage. In addition, the percentage change in successive Standards for cohorts starting with Standard 3 could be calculated to determine the change between successive Standards for a cohort. Such percentage change calculations are commonly used in demographic studies.

Methods The methods used in the present work are based on the demographic methods of cohort analysis. The cohorts used in this part of the study were created using real data from a primary source in the form of the recorded number of pupils at each Standard level in each Education District, along with published pass and fail rates for each Standard for the whole Education District. The expected numbers of pupils in successive Standards in successive years were calculated manually and these were compared with the observed number of pupils as recorded in the education data for the same Education District. A series of studies and calculations were then carried out comparing the observed and expected figures to determine at what Standard or level the greatest changes occurred. In this part of the project gender differences could not be calculated as the pass and fail rates available and thus the calculated numbers were for all pupils together rather than being available for males and females separately. Some comments in the published literature appear to suggest that it is possible that the pass rates were different for males and females (Fry, 1985, p. 9; Shuker, 1987, p. 212). However, since the numbers of boys and girls in each Standard level are available, further research may be possible to try to determine gender differences, at least in a crude way, using the same pass rates for both genders. This would involve considerable additional manual calculations and so was not attempted here.

Chapter 3 Results by Education District ­ North Island
Auckland Age and gender The gender ratios for 5-6 y/7-9 y show little difference for males and females. After an initial decline in the ratios in the early 1880s, possibly linked to a drop in fertility in the New Zealand population at this time, the ratios remained remarkably constant for the remaining years of the nineteenth century, rising only slightly around the turn of the twentieth century. These results suggest that both boys and girls in the 5-6 y age group were attending school in equal numbers.

The ratio of pupils 13-14 y/7-9 y, calculated for each year from 1880 to 1911, shows a general increase over the three decades (Fig. 4). This increase is steadier for males than for females, with a tendency for the ratio for the female ratio to decline somewhat from about 1900. This decline, in conjunction with the rise in the ratio for males, leads to a cross-over between the lines for the two genders. From 1880 to 1900 the ratio for females is greater than for males. After 1900 this is reversed, with the ratio for males being higher that that for females.

These ratios suggest that the female pupils aged 13-14 y in each year constitute about 30% of the 7-9 y female pupils in 1880, rising to about 38% in 1894 and then declining to about 32% in 1908.

These results suggest that in the Auckland Education District something encouraged females to leave school earlier from about 1900 compared with males; this is suggested because the ratio of younger pupils (5-6 y) to the same denominator (7-9 y) does not show similar differences for the two genders.

29 To consider changes for individual cohorts, the proportion of the 5-15 y pupil population in each age group was calculated. Six constructed cohorts were considered for males and females separately. For males, the proportion of males in the total population for the period 1880 to 1911 was calculated. During the nineteenth century males made up close to 52% of the total pupil population, and this rose to close to 53% in the early years of the new century before declining slightly at the end of the first decade of the twentieth century to settle at just over 52% again. In addition, the proportion of males in each of the three age groups (7-9 y, 10-12 y, 13-14 y) was calculated and compared with the overall proportion of male pupils (Table 3; Fig. 5).

Cohorts 1 and 2 show that there were fewer males in the oldest age group; this pattern is reversed for Cohorts 5 and 6 where there were more males in the oldest age group. These trends are reversed for females (Fig. 6) with more females in the oldest age group for Cohorts 1 and 2 and fewer for Cohorts 5 and 6 (Table 4; Fig. 6).

In Figs 5 and 6 the high proportions of each gender is obviously related to the low proportions for the other gender. A high proportion indicates either that there were excess pupils of that gender in that age group OR that there were fewer pupils of the other gender in that age group. Thus for example, if significant numbers of males left schooling before the age of 13 y, then there would be a lower value for the proportion of males in the 13-14 y age group and, at the same time, this would result in an apparent increase in the females in that age group. Figs 5 and 6 on their own do not allow a distinction between one gender leaving schooling early or the other gender staying at school. However, in conjunction with Fig. 4, it can be suggested that from 1900 females were leaving school earlier and thus the rise in the male Cohorts 5 and 6 results not from males remaining longer at school but from females leaving earlier.

Standards levels Using the number of pupils in each Standard and the pass and fail rates for pupils at each Standard examination, the expected number of pupils in successive Standards can be calculated. From these pupil numbers, the number of pupils actually present in each successive Standard can be used to calculate the ratio of observed pupils to expected pupils for each Standard above Standard 3.

Fig. 7 ­ Auckland Education District: Ratio of observed pupil numbers to expected pupil numbers for Standards 4, 5 and 6 (Source: E-1 Reports) ratio for Standard 4 increases slightly from about 0.7 to about 0.9 by 1893 and to about 0.95 by 1904 (Fig. 7).

For Standard 5 the general trend is an increase in the ratio after variable results until about 1888. In the late 1880s the ratio is about 0.7 and rises slowly until it reaches about 0.85 in the early 1900s. For Standard 6 the trends are less clear; there is a slight increase over the period from a ratio of about 0.6 to a ratio of close to 0.8 in the 1890 and then a decline in the early 1900s to a ratio of about 0.7.

The data in Fig. 7 indicate that more pupils leave the pupil population at each successive Standard level: about 80% of the possible pupils from Standard 3 are present at Standard 4; for Standard 5 the ratio indicates that an increasing proportion of Standard 4 pupils remain to Standard 5, increasing from about 70% of possible pupils present in Standard 4 in the 1880s to about 85% of possible pupils by the early 1900s. The trends for Standard 6 are less clear with fluctuations about 70% of possible pupils from Standard 5 remaining to Standard 6 until the turn of the century when the value settles at about 70% of Standard 5 pupils remaining to Standard 6.

31 To further study the changes between successive Standards, the % change between Standards was calculated: this indicates the amount of pupil "loss" between successive Standards over the period 1881 to 1904. Fig. 8 shows that the loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4 was initially about 40% (in the early 1880s) with a rapid decrease in the loss during the late 1880s. By 1888 the loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4 was less than 20%. The decrease in the loss continued during the early 1890s and by 1896 there was little loss of pupils between Standard 3 and Standard 4. After the turn of the century, however, there was a slight increase in the loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4, with this loss being about 5% in 1902.

The loss of pupils from Standard 4 to Standard 5 was greater than the loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4, as would be expected. In the early 1880s the loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 was around 50%; the loss decreased during the late 1880s and by the early 1890s the loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 had settled at about 28%. This level remained until about the turn of the century when there was a sharp decrease in the loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5. By 1903 the loss had decreased to just over 10%.

32 The loss of pupils from Standard 5 to Standard 6 was rather more variable especially during the 1880s. In the early 1880s the loss from Standard 5 to Standard 6 was over 50%. This level remained until the early 1890s when the loss began to decrease slowly, from just under 50% in 1890 to just below 30% in 1900. During the early 1900s the loss from Standard 5 to Standard 6 settled at around 25%.

Using the data from Fig. 8, individual constructed Standard cohorts were created (Fig. 9). The first point for each cohort is the % loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4; the second point (joined by a line to the first to indicate that it is the same cohort as the first point) indicates the % loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5; similarly the third point indicates the % loss from Standard 5 to Standard 6 for each cohort.

A pattern can be seen from Fig. 9: in the early 1880s there are similar losses at each successive Standard since the lines between successive points for each cohort are relatively short and of similar length. From the mid-1880s (Standard 3 cohort of 1885)

Each line represents a single constructed cohort starting in Standard 3; the length of the line between points indicates the percentage loss between successive Standards ­ the longer the line, the greater the loss (calculated from E-1 reports)

33 there is a change in pattern: there is now a smaller loss between Standard 3 and Standard 4 (the first point for each cohort), a moderate loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 (the first line for each cohort) and a greater loss between Standard 5 and Standard 6 (the length of the second line for each cohort is longer than the first line). This pattern continues until the 1890 Standard 3 cohort. With this cohort there is another change in pattern, with the loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4 being very small, the loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 being over 20% and the loss from Standard 5 to Standard 6 being much less. This pattern continued until the start of the twentieth century. For the Standard 3 cohort of 1900 the loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 is once again less than the loss from Standard 5 to Standard 6.

These changes in the constructed cohorts over time indicate that during the 1880s pupils were frequently leaving school before reaching Standard 6. After 1890, there was a large loss of pupils after Standard 4 and before Standard 5, with little loss before Standard 4. After the turn of the century, there was once again a greater loss after Standard 5 and before Standard 6.

These results once again point to a change in pupils leaving school in this Education District at the turn of the century. At the beginning of the twentieth century pupils were leaving school earlier than before and with a lower level of qualification.

Summary for Auckland Education District In summary, in the Auckland Education District, there were changes at certain times which need to be explained. The retention of pupils to the age of 14 y may be related to legislation prohibiting the employment of children under the age of 14 years in factories. In addition, the change in the level of exemption from Standard 4 to Standard 5 in 1899 may have affected the retention of pupils past Standard 4; the retention of pupils to Standard 6 would not have been affected by exemption legislation as the school leaving level was not raised to Standard 6 until 1914.

For many younger people, particularly males, school leaving was probably related to employment opportunities in the region. Employment of younger males was greater than employment of younger females but was considerably less for pupils below 14 years compared with the opportunities for both males and females aged 15-19 y. The

34 employment opportunities for both males and females thus need to be investigated for the Auckland Education District particularly during the 1880s and early 1890s (when more females were retained at school to 13-14 y than males) and also after the turn of the century when female retention to age 14 y was less than for males. Retention into the highest Standard also was low after the turn of the century, suggesting that perhaps that young people were drawn to employment rather than schooling.

Hawke's Bay Age and gender The 5-6 y/7-9 y ratios for both males and females fluctuate somewhat, particularly during the nineteenth century. However, these ratios generally settle around 0.5 by the 1890s. The decline in both ratios during the 1880s may be related to declining fertility in the population.

The ratio of pupils 13-14 y/7-9 y shows an increase from the late 1880s to the turn of the century (Fig. 10). There are no consistent differences between the genders except for a slightly lower ratio for females after the turn of the century. During the

35 nineteenth century the ratio of 13-14 y/7-9 y started at just over 20% and during the 1880s rose to reach about 35% by the end of the century.

These results suggest that whatever influenced pupils to remain at school to the age of 13-14 y applied equally to both males and females. During the early 1880s, until about 1885, there were more males than females attending schools, with over 53% of pupils being males. From the mid-1880s to the mid-1890s the percentage of males declined to just over 52%, and then rose to settle near 53%.

Individual age cohorts show no clear pattern. Of the six cohorts studied, the proportion of males in the 13-14 y age group is alternately higher than the overall percentage of males and then lower than the overall percentage of males (Fig. 11). The only trend that can be discerned is that the last two cohorts show a pattern of increasing proportions of pupils at the higher age groups; similarly for females in the last two cohorts there is a decline in the proportion of females in the 13-14 y age group (Fig. 12). This could be because females were leaving school earlier or males were staying at school longer than females.

Standards levels The ratio of observed to expected numbers of pupils were considered from 1880 to 1903 (Fig. 13). For Standard 4 there are initially considerable fluctuations in the ratio until the early 1890s. After this, the ratio fluctuates a little around the 90% level. For Standard 5 there are fewer fluctuations with the ratio being around 70% until the early 1890s after which the ratio increased to around 85%. For Standard 6 there were far fewer pupils at this level compared to the possible number. The ratio in the early 1880s was around 30% of expected pupils, rising slowly but reasonably steadily through the nineteenth century and on into the twentieth century. By the early years of the twentieth century the number of pupils in Standard 6 was about 60% of expected.

The percentage change between successive Standards is shown in Fig. 14. This graph shows that there was initially a loss of about 20% between Standard 3 and Standard 4

new century. A trend worth noting is that during the 1890s the patterns of retention and loss from both Standard 3 to Standard 4 and from Standard 4 to Standard 5 are similar, indicating that whatever influenced pupils to remain at school or leave school during the 1890s applied to both Standard 4 and Standard 5 pupils. Retention in Standard 6 shows a different pattern.

Fig. 15 ­ Hawke's Bay Education District: The percentage changes between Standards 3 and 4, between Standards 4 and 5, and between Standards 5 and 6. Each line represents a single constructed cohort starting in Standard 3; the length of the line between points indicates the percentage loss between successive Standards ­ the longer the line, the greater the loss (calculated from E-1 reports) When individual Standard 3 cohorts are considered, there are changes in retention over time (Fig. 15). In the early years of the 1880s there was a loss of almost one third between Standard 3 and Standard 4 with another large loss between Standard 4 and Standard 5 and a slightly smaller loss from Standard 5 to Standard 6. During the middle years of the 1880s there was a much greater loss from Standard 5 to Standard 6 with a smaller loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4.

From the later years of the 1880s until after the turn of the century, with a few exceptions, the loss of pupils was greater from Standard 5 to Standard 6 than from Standard 4 to Standard 5. At the turn of the century there was still a loss of around 10% from Standard 3 to Standard 4 and during the 1890s the loss was between 10% and 20%.

Summary for Hawke's Bay Education District The results reported for this Education District indicate that, although there were generally more males than females attending school throughout the period under

41 consideration, for pupils aged 13-14 y there were few differences between males and females. The only difference appears at the beginning of the 1900s when either more males aged 13-14 y remained at school or alternatively more females aged 13-14 y left school.

Throughout most of the 1890s and at the start of the new century, there was a greater loss of pupils between Standard 5 and Standard 6 than between other Standards suggesting that perhaps pupils did not see Standard 6 as being of particular use in their employment prospects. There was also still a significant loss of pupils between Standard 3 and Standard 4 of over 10% perhaps again indicating that employment in this Education District was not dependent on higher qualifications.

Taranaki Age and gender The 5-6 y/7-9 y ratios fluctuate for both genders. The decline in the 1880s may be related to the decreasing fertility of the population. The ratios remain below 0.5 during the 1890s perhaps indicating that children started school later than in some other Education Districts.

43 Through most of the 1880s there were more females aged 13-14 y than males (Fig. 16). The ratio of 13-14 y/7-9 y fluctuated around the 30% level throughout the time period under consideration. During the 1880s and early 1890s the ratio for females was greater than that for males; during the 1890s the ratios for the two genders were similar and did not change greatly; from the turn of the century the ratio for males was greater than for females, and in the first decade of the new century the ratio for both males and females decreased. These results indicate that during the 1880s females were tending to stay at school longer than males. After the turn of the twentieth century, the reverse appears to have been the case, with fewer females in the 13-14 y age group remaining at school. This result is suggested because the ratio for the younger age group (5-6 y) to the same denominator (7-9 y) does not show the same gender differences.

The same trends can be seen when individual constructed age cohorts are followed. For males the proportion of the male 5-15 y population in the highest age group was below the overall proportion of males in the total pupil population for Cohorts 1 and 2, but for Cohorts 4, 5 and 6 the proportion of males in the 13-14 y age group was greater than the proportion of males in the total pupil population (Fig. 17). The reverse is, therefore, the case for females for the same cohorts (Fig. 18). These results can be interpreted as either males remained at school in Cohorts 4, 5, and 6 or females were leaving school before reaching this age group in these three cohorts. Standards levels From calculations of the ratio of observed to expected pupils in various Standards, it is clear that there was little change in the ratio for Standard 4 during much of the time under consideration: from the mid-1880s until the first years of the new century, the ratio of observed to expected pupils in Standard 4 was around 85%, rising slightly to about 90% from 1902 (Fig. 19).

The ratio of observed to expected Standard 5 pupils (Fig. 19) shows marked variability until the mid-1890s: during the late 1890s there is an increase in the Standard 5 ratio from about 65% to reach 80% by the turn of the century; the early years of the new century saw a further small increase in the Standard 5 ratio to about 85%.

Fig. 20 shows that the loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4 in the 1880s decreased from about 45% to about 35% and then decreased sharply in the early 1890s. From the mid1890s until the end of the century the decrease from Standard 3 to Standard 4 declined slowly to reach about 10% by 1899. This level was maintained for the first 3 years of the new century before reducing further to less than 10%.

Fig. 21 ­ Taranaki Education District: The percentage changes between Standards 3 and 4, between Standards 4 and 5, and between Standards 5 and 6. Each line represents a single constructed cohort starting in Standard 3; the length of the line between points indicates the percentage loss between successive Standards ­ the longer the line, the greater the loss (calculated from E-1 reports) The decrease in pupils from Standard 4 to Standard 5 showed an initial decrease and then a period of increase until the late 1880s (Fig. 20). From the late 1880s to the mid1890s the change from Standard 4 to Standard 5 fluctuated annually, before settling to around 40% during the late 1890s. From the turn of the century there was a marked decline in the decrease from Standard 4 to Standard 5, peaking in 1902 at about 20% before declining slightly.

During the late nineteenth century the decrease from Standard 5 to Standard 6 shows a general trend towards a reduction in the decline of pupils, albeit with a number of fluctuations along the way (Fig. 20). From 1899 there is a marked steady reduction in the decrease from Standard 5 to Standard 6, peaking in 1902 at just over 30% before settling at around 40%.

From calculations of individual constructed Standards cohorts, there is a general trend throughout the nineteenth century for the decrease in pupils from Standard 3 to

19

04

48 Standard 4 to decrease (Fig. 21); from the turn of the century this decrease appears to be halted.

From the 1880s to the early 1890s the cohort decrease between Standard 4 and Standard 5 is generally less than the decrease from Standard 5 to Standard 6. This pattern changes from the early 1890s, with the decrease from Standard 4 to Standard 5 being generally greater than from Standard 5 to Standard 6. These results indicate that during the late 1890s pupils who reached Standard 4 were more likely to leave school than those who reached Standard 5.

Summary for Taranaki Education District In summary, there are fewer 13-14 y females remaining at school than 13-14 y males. The loss of pupils from Standard 5 and 6 decreases markedly after 1899 perhaps related to the introduction of the new Standard 5 level of exemption in this year. In this Education District there is a general trend, with some exceptions, for pupils to leave after Standard 4 rather than after Standard 5.

There are changes in the patterns seen for both ages and Standards around the turn of the twentieth century which indicate the existence of some factors that influenced pupil attendance at school; these factors would need further investigation.

Wanganui Age and gender The ratio for males and females for 5-6 y/7-9 y show little difference between the genders. After the decline in the early 1880s for both genders, the ratios settle just below 0.5 and remain remarkably stable throughout the remainder of the time period under consideration.

The ratio of males 13-14 y/7-9 y shows a general increase from the mid-1880s (Fig. 22), rising from about 25% in 1885 to a plateau of about 37% at the beginning of the twentieth century, and then rising further to reach 40% by 1909. For females the trends are less steady with a rise in the ratio from about 22% in the mid-1880s to about 36% by the turn of the century; there is then a decrease in the ratio during the

Fig. 22 ­ Wanganui Education District: Ratios for male and female pupils aged 5-6 y and 13-14 y in the numerator, and aged 7-9 y in the denominator, 1880­1911 (calculated from various E-1 Reports) early 1900s followed a small rise to a plateau at about 34% and with only a small rise to about 35% by the end of the first decade of the twentieth century.

During much of the time from the mid-1880s until the first decade of the twentieth century, the ratio for females is, with a few exceptions, below that of males, indicating that generally there were fewer females than males in the 13-14 y age group.

Six individual age cohorts were synthetically constructed and compared for males and females separately. Cohorts 1, 4 and 6 for males show a higher than expected ratio of 13-14 y males (Fig. 23); numbers for the other age groups are about as expected, based on the proportion of males in the total pupil population.

Since the proportion of females is the converse of the proportion of males, in the highest age group for Cohorts 1, 4 and 6 the proportion of females in the 13-14 y age

54 observed to expected ratio for Standard 4 is close to 90%; the ratio for Standard 5 is about 70%; and the ratio for Standard 6 is about 65%.

From the mid-1890s there is a slow but steady increase in the ratio for Standard 4, rising to close to 10% by the early years of the twentieth century. For Standard 5, there is a more marked rise from the last year of the nineteenth century, the ratio rising from about 72% in 1899 to about 92% by 1904.

For Standard 6 there is no clear pattern of increase, although from the mid-1890s to the middle of the first decade of the twentieth century the ratio for Standard 6 increased slightly from about 70% to about 77%.

The trends for the three Standards can be more clearly seen in Fig. 26, where the % change between successive Standards can be tracked. This graph shows the uneven rise in the Standard 4 line which, by the turn of the century, indicates that about 10% of the expected pupils in Standard 4 were not present. However, by 1902 the number of pupils in Standard 4 was at the expected level.

For Standard 5, the loss form the previous Standard compared to the expected number of pupils was just over 40%, but this loss decreased markedly from the mid-1890s, rising from a loss of over 40% to a loss of only 15% by 1902 with a further reduction to just over 10% by 1904. This graph indicates that, from the late 1890s, pupils were remaining at school into Standard 5 rather than leaving school after Standard 4. This is likely to be related to the increase in the level of exemption from Standard 4 to Standard 5 in 1899.

When the losses for individual Standard cohorts are studied, there is a still a general pattern of pupils leaving school after Standard 4 (Fig. 27); the length of the line from the first point of each cohort to the second point is generally longer than the length of the line from the second to the third point, although over the whole time period there are a number of exceptions. There is a small change around the turn of the century with slightly more pupils leaving after Standard 5 than after Standard 4, again probably related to the exemption level changes.

Summary for Wanganui Education District In summary, for the Wanganui Education District there were generally more males in the 13-14 y age group than there were females, perhaps because females left school within this age group. The loss of pupils at Standard 4 decreased slowly during the last decade of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. For Standards 5 and 6 there was a decrease in the loss of pupils, but only near the end of the nineteenth century with the loss from Standard 5 decreasing from about 1896 and the decrease from Standard 6 decreasing from about 1898. From individual Standard cohorts, it seems clear that in general, pupils usually left after reaching Standard 4 rather than remaining to Standard 5. This pattern changed slightly at the turn of the century with pupils now remaining to Standard 5 and then leaving, probably as a result of the rise in the level of exemption.

56 Wellington Age and gender The 5-6 y/7-9 y gender ratios show little difference between the genders. The decline in the 1880s is similar to that seen in other Education Districts. From the late 1880s the ratios settle at around 0.5 and remain at this level for the remainder of the time period under consideration.

The ratio of both males and females shows an increase from the mid-1880s to the turn of the century; the increase is steadier for males than for females with the trend for females showing some troughs and plateaus (Fig. 28). Before the mid-1880s the ratio for females is higher than that for males, but from the mid-1880s to the turn of the century the ratio for females is slightly lower than that for males, perhaps indicating that females were leaving school at an earlier age than males.

In 1904 the ratio for males rose markedly and then fell away in 1906, followed by a plateau. For females at this time there was a steady decrease in the ratio, indicating that females were leaving school at an earlier age than males during the first decade of

Individual male age cohorts show differences over time. During the late 1880s and early 1890s the proportion of males in the 13-14 y age group was much greater than the proportion of females (Cohorts 2 and 3; Figs 29 and 30); Cohort 6 shows a different pattern again with few males of all age groups in the population. This could have resulted because more girls of all ages were attending school or because there

60 was a drop in the number of males attending school. However, note how the proportion of females in the total pupil population 5-15 y decreased from about 48.5% in the mid-1890s to a low of about 47.2% in 1905, rising again from 1908 to 1911 when it had reached 47.8%. These results could equally be interpreted as indicating that more males were attending school.

Standards levels The ratio for observed number of pupils in each Standard compared to the expected number shows remarkably little change over the 25 years under consideration (Fig. 31). The ratio for Standard 4 rises in the mid-1880s to over 90% and remains over 90% for the rest of the time period. For Standard 5, there is a slight increase in the ration observed to expected from about 80% during the 1880s to about 85% during the 1890s and about 90% from around the turn of the century. For Standard 6 there is greater variability during the early 1880s, followed by a period of some ten years with remarkably little change except for a small rise and then a decrease in the late 1880s. The ratio for Standard 6 remained at about 70% until the late 1890s when the ratio increased to about 80% but fell back slightly after the turn of the century to below 80%.

Fig. 33 ­ Wellington Education District: The percentage changes between Standards 3 and 4, between Standards 4 and 5, and between Standards 5 and 6. Each line represents a single constructed cohort starting in Standard 3; the length of the line between points indicates the percentage loss between successive Standards ­ the longer the line, the greater the loss (calculated from E-1 reports)

62 shows more trends (Fig. 32). For Standard 4, the change during the nineteenth century shows a steady decrease in the loss at this level, rising from a loss in 1884 of about 35% to a loss in 1894 of only about 3%. From this time on, the loss for this Standard was always 5% or less.

For Standard 5, there was an initial sharp decrease in loss in the early 1880s followed by an increased drop in1886. After this until the early 1890s there was a reasonably steady decrease in the loss at Standard 5, followed by an increase in the loss from 1892 to 1894. During the late 1890s there was once again a decrease in the loss from Standard 5, peaking at a loss of only 7% in 1899 before increasing again to more than 10% after the turn of the century.

For Standard 6 there was an initial increase in loss in the early 1880s followed by a sharp decrease in loss in 1884. The remainder of the 1880s saw a fluctuating trend but a general decrease in the loss from Standard 6, peaking at a loss of just over 20% in 1889. After this time, there were fluctuations in the loss from Standard 6 but there was no clear trend towards a decrease in the Standard 6 losses, which remained at about 25% throughout this time.

When individual Standard cohorts are studied, there is no clear pattern during the 1880s (Fig. 33). During the early 1890s the losses were greater after Standard 5 than after Standard 4, but during the late 1890s this trend was reversed with greater losses after Standard 4 rather than after Standard 5. After the turn of the century the losses were greater after Standard 5 rather than after Standard 4.

Summary for Wellington Education District For the Wellington Education District there are no consistent gender differences for the age groups studied. There is a rather steep rise in the ratio of the 13-14 y age group from the mid-1880s to the mid-1890s for both genders. The reason for this is not discernable from the present study, but could relate to the decrease in fertility of the New Zealand population from the late 1870s. This possible relationship would need further investigation.

63 For the derived age cohorts, the proportion of males in the 13-14 y age group is higher (by over 2%) than that in the proportion of males in the total school population in the 1890s, and similarly the proportion of females in this age group at this time is below the proportion of females in the school population.

From the early 1890s the loss of pupils between Standard 3 and Standard 4 had reached about 8% and remained at this level until the first decade of the twentieth century. Losses between successive Standards were variable up to the 1890s, but until 1892 the losses between Standard 5 and Standard 6 were generally greater than those between Standard 4 and Standard 5. Then, until 1898 the losses were greater between Standard 4 and Standard 5 than between Standard 5 and Standard 6. After 1898 the pattern was reversed with losses being greater at the higher levels between Standard 5 and Standard 6.

Once again in this Education District there are changes in the patterns of school attendance at the end of the nineteenth century which need to be explained.

Marlborough Age and gender While there are marked fluctuations for both males and females for the ratio 5-6 y/7-9 y, the overall pattern is the same as found in other Education Districts: an initial decline in the ratio for both genders during the 1880s, followed by a more stable pattern with both ratios being close to 0.5.

During the late nineteenth century there was a rise in the ratio of 13-14 y/7-9 y pupils, both males and females, especially during the late 1880s and early 1890s (Fig. 34). However, the pattern is not clear especially during the late 1890s. After the turn of the century the ratio 13-14 y/7-9 y decreased slightly, especially for females. During the decade from the mid-1880s to the mid-1890s the ratio for females was lower than that for males; from the mid-1890s to just after the turn of the century the ratio for females was slightly higher than for males, but the female ratio dropped below that for males again after 1900 and remained below the male ratio until 1911.

The lower ratio for 13-14 y females perhaps suggests that more females in this age group were leaving school than males in this age group, since the ratios for males and females in the younger age groups (5-6 y) does not show the same gender differences and the denominator is the same for this age group as for the older age group.

Individual age cohorts were created synthetically. For males, during the 1880s and the mid-1890s the proportion of males in the 13-14 y age group was greater than the proportion of males in the total pupil population (Fig. 35). During the 1890s the ratio of males in all age groups was lower than the proportion of males in the total pupil

69 population, with a significantly lower ratio for the 13-14 y age group. At the turn of the century the ratios for the three age groups for males was close to the proportion of males in the total pupil population. For the final cohort from 1905 the ratio of males in the two younger age groups was lower than the proportion of males in the total pupil population, with the proportion of males in the highest age group being as found in the total pupil population.

For females the trends seen for males are reversed since the proportions of females in each age group are the converse of the proportions for males (Fig. 36). The greatest points of interest are the increased proportions of males and the lower proportion of females in the 13-14 y age group in the later 1880s and early 1890s; also the low proportion of males and the high proportion of females in the 13-14 y age group in 1897. In all these cases it is not clear whether the differences are the result of males remaining at school longer or females leaving school earlier in the first two cases and the opposite occurring in the third case.

Similarly, there was a higher proportion of females aged 7-9 y and 10-12 y in the early 1900s and a lower proportion of males in these age groups; this could be because younger males were not attending school or because younger females were increasingly attending school.

Standards levels The ratio of observed to expected pupil numbers in the higher Standards was calculated. The ratio for Standard 4 shows a small increase during the 1880s and by the early 1890s the observed rate was close to 90% of the expected rate (Fig. 37). This rate was maintained into the twentieth century until 1904 when more pupils were present in Standard 4 than had been expected, perhaps because of an inflow of pupils into the district or because pupils did not want to leave school without passing Standard 4.

The trends for the observed to expected pupils number for Standards 5 and 6 show few clear trends, although there was a slight increase in the number of pupils remaining into Standard 5 over the time period.

The % changes for each Standard over time are shown in Fig. 38. The % change for Standard 4, while fluctuating, shows a general trend towards increasing retention in this Standard during the nineteenth century. By the end of the nineteenth century the loss from this Standard was less than 10%.

The observed % change for Standard 5 also fluctuated, especially during the 1880s. During the 1890s there was a steady decrease in the loss from this Standard, dropping from a loss of over 30% to a loss of just over 10% in 1896. During the last years of the nineteenth century the loss from Standard 5 increased slightly and by 1900 was close to 20%. Thereafter, there was a sharp decrease in the loss from Standard 5 to well below 10%. This change may have been related to the change in the level of exemption from Standard 4 to Standard 5 in 1899.

The trends in pupil loss from Standard 6 can be divided into several sections. From 1883 to 1886 there was a sharp decrease in the loss from this Standard followed by fluctuations in loss from this Standard until 1893 with the losses being around 40%.

72 During the 1890s there was a sharp decrease in loss followed by an even greater increase in loss from Standard 6, reaching 50% in1897. From 1897 to 1901 there was a sharp marked decrease in loss from the Standard to reach under 10% loss, but after the turn of the century the losses from Standard 6 again increased to over 20%.

A study of individual constructed Standards cohort shows that during the 1880s generally there was a greater loss between Standard 4 and Standard 5 than between Standard 5 and Standard 6 (Fig. 39), although there were some cohorts that were exceptions to this trend. During the remainder of the time period there are no clear trends in the loss from these higher Standards.

Summary for Marlborough Education District There are few consistent gender differences but from the mid-1880s to the mid-1890s the ratio for 13-14 y males was greater than for females. A similar pattern is seen from the turn of the century.

For age cohorts, there was a slightly greater proportion of 13-14 y males in the mid1880s and early 1890s and fewer 13-14 y males in the mid- to late 1890s compared to the proportion of males in the total pupil population. Similarly, there were fewer females in the 13-14 y age group in the mid-1880s and early 1890s compared to the proportion of females in the total pupil population. The loss of pupils in successive Standards fluctuates throughout the years studied. Every 2-3 years the pattern changes, at times markedly, so that at times the loss is greater from Standard 4 to Standard 5 than from Standard 5 to Standard 6 and a few years later this is reversed.

In this Education District at the turn of the twentieth century there is a change in pattern in the age ratios, but there is no clear change in pattern in the Standards cohorts at this time.

73 Nelson Age and gender The ratio 5-6 y/7-9 y for both genders follows a similar pattern to that seen in other Education Districts. From a high plateau in the early 1880s, there is a marked decline in the ratio for both genders during the late 1880s. The ratios then fluctuate between 0.5 and 0.6, a slightly higher value than is found for a number of other Education Districts.

The ratio of 13-14 y/7-9 y for both males and females increases during the 1890s but after the turn of the century the ratio for both genders decreases (Fig. 40). During most of the nineteenth century the ratio for females is higher than that for males; however, from 1898 to 1904 the ratio for females is lower than that for males and falls from about 48% in 1897 to 34% in 1904. From 1906 there is no consistent pattern for the ratio for males and females. The higher ratio for females in the nineteenth century suggests that there are more females in the 13-14 y age group than there are males. The converse is the case after 1898 when the ratio for females is lower than that for males, suggesting that at this time females were leaving school in greater number from this age group than were males.

When individual age cohorts are created synthetically and followed (Figs 41 and 42), it appears that for Cohorts 1 and 2 either the females remain at school longer than the males or the males leave school at an earlier age. For Cohort 3 there is little difference between the genders. Cohort 4 indicates that either males are remaining at school into

78 Standards levels The ratio of observed to expected pupil numbers in the three highest Standards shows that in the early 1880s there was no clear pattern (Fig. 43). From the mid-1880s the ratio for Standard 4 was about 90% and changed little over the years. Similar patterns can be seen for both Standard 5 and Standard 6 which have a ratio of about 85% and this ratio changes little over the time period under consideration.

Calculations of the changes observed between successive Standards shows that there was little change for Standard 4 over the time period (Fig. 44). For Standard 5, there was a decrease in the % change during the 1880s rising from a decrease of close to 50% in the early 1880s to a loss of only about 15% by1889. After a small increase in 1890 and 1891 there was a marked rise in the decrease for Standard 5 in1892, rising to about 5%, a level maintained until 1894 after which the % change decreased again, and for the rest of the nineteenth century the loss remained between 15% and 10% loss. From 1901 the loss from Standard 5 diminished gradually to reach about 10% by 1904.

Each line represents a single constructed cohort starting in Standard 3; the length of the line between points indicates the percentage loss between successive Standards ­ the longer the line, the greater the loss (calculated from E-1 reports)

79 For Standard 6 the % loss fluctuated considerably throughout the 1880s and into the early 1890s, although there was a gradual decrease in the loss of this Standard from over 50% in 1882 to just over 20% in 1891. During the 1890s there was little change in the % loss from this Standard; at the beginning of the new century there were fluctuations in the loss from Standard 6 but the loss declined slightly from about 23% in 1902 to 20% in 1904.

When individual constructed Standards cohorts are followed there is no clear pattern over the time period under consideration (Fig. 45). The main point to note is that there was very little loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4 throughout the whole period. However, in the early years of the 1880s there appears to be a greater loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 than from Standard 5 to Standard 6. During the 1890s there were some cohorts that showed a greater loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 and other cohorts that showed a greater loss from Standard 5 to Standard 6. From the 1899 Standard 3 cohort there was a greater loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 than from Standard 5 to Standard 6.

Summary for Nelson Education District There are no consistent gender differences for the 5-6 y age group for the Nelson Education District during the years being studied. However, during the nineteenth century there was a tendency for the 13-14 y female ratio to be below the male ratio for this age group. Individual cohorts of pupils show the proportion of 13-14 y males was below the proportion of males in the whole pupil population during the 1880s and early 1890s, and the proportion for males in this age group was above that of the whole pupil population in the early 1900s. Similarly, the ratios for females in the 1314 y age group are the reverse of those for males, being below the ratio of females in the pupil population at the times when the proportion of males was higher.

Until the mid-1880s there was a tendency for a greater loss of pupils between Standard 4 and Standard 5 than between Standard 5 and Standard 6 although there are some variations. During the late 1880s the losses between the various higher Standards were similar. The retention of pupils from Standard 3 to Standard 4 was always high in the Nelson Education District, rarely being more than a 10% loss which is much lower than in some other Education Districts. In the mid-1890s the

80 losses from Standard 5 to Standard 6 were greater than the losses from Standard 4 to Standard 5, with some variations in the late 1890s before a new pattern was established around the turn of the century when losses from Standard 4 to Standard 5 were greater than losses from Standard 5 to Standard 6.

Grey Age and gender The Grey Education District was established from the Westland Education District in 1885 and so no data are available before 1885 for this Education District.

The 5-6 y/7-9 y ratios for both males and females fluctuate markedly throughout the time period under consideration. However, from the mid-1890s the ratios are generally above 0.6, which may indicate a higher proportion of younger pupils attending schools in this Education District.

For both males and females the ratio of 13-14 y to 7-9 y pupils rose during the late 1880s and early 1890s and there was little difference for the two genders (Fig. 46). After 1895 the pattern for males and females is different. For males, after an initial

81 small increase there was a larger increase to 1898 and a further small increase to 1899. Thereafter, the ratio for males decreased from a peak of about 65% in 1899 to a low of less than 30% in 1907 before rising again slightly.

For females the ratio of 13-14 y to 7-9 y plateaued during the later 1890s to about 47%, then rose slightly in 1899 to about 53% before falling over the next 6 years to a low of about 35% before rising in 1906 and then falling again over the following 6 years. From 1897 to 1905 the ratio for females was lower than the ratio for males suggesting that there were few females in this age group than there were males, in turn suggesting that females may have left school at an earlier age than males.

Constructed age cohorts show few trends, although for males Cohort 3 shows an elevated level for the 13-14 y proportion and there is a lowered proportion for this age group for Cohort 4 (Fig. 47).

For females the trends are the reverse of those seen for males because the ratios for females are the converse of those for males (Fig. 48). For females the lower value for the 13-14 y ratio in 1901 may indicate that females in this age group were leaving school in greater numbers than were males or that males were staying at school in greater numbers than females. It is not possible to decide which of these is correct. Similarly for the 13-14 y age group in 1906, females may have stayed at school more than males or males may have left school in greater numbers than females.

Standards levels Because the new Grey Education District was set up in 1885, the distribution of pupils in the various Standards was not stable until the end of the 1880s. Throughout the 1890s the ratio of observed to expected pupils in Standard 4 changed little and was about 90% (Fig. 49). At the turn of the century there was an increase in the ratio for Standard 4 and in 1901 and 1902 this ratio was above the expected level being over 1.0, indicating that more pupils were attending the schools at this level that the previous pupil population had suggested.

For Standard 6 the ratio fluctuates considerably; during the early 1890s the ratio is reasonably static at around 50% and during the late 1890s the ratio, while more variable, fluctuates at around 75%. After 1898 the ratio for Standard 6 decreases until 1901, falling from about 85% to about 63% and then rises markedly to about 83% in 1902 before stabilizing close to 80%.

86 The % change between the observed pupil numbers show that from 1888 to 1892 there was over 10% loss at Standard 4, but after this there was a gain in pupils at the Standard 4 level or only minimal loss from this Standard (Fig. 50). The trends for % change for Standard 5 show considerable fluctuations, although there is a general trend towards fewer losses from this Standard over time. There are similar fluctuations in the % change for Standard 6; however, there is a marked decrease in pupil loss from Standard 6 from 1901 to 1903 with losses rising from about 45% to about 5% before falling back slightly to 10% in 1904.

The % change for individual constructed cohorts shows that there are changing patterns of pupil loss (Fig. 51). Until the late 1880s there is greater loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 than from Standard 5 to Standard 6. During the early 1890s the loss is similar from Standard 4 to Standard 5 and from Standard 5 to Standard 6. From 1893 until the early years of the twentieth century the loss is generally greater between Standard 4 and Standard 5 than between Standard 5 and Standard 6, although after the turn of the century there is greater variation among the cohorts.

Summary for Grey Education District The Grey Education District was established in 1885 by the division of the Westland Education District.

There were no consistent gender differences for the 5-6 y age group of pupils. However, for the 13-14 y age group that ratio of males exceeds that of females from the mid-1890s until the middle of the first decade of the twentieth century. Age cohorts show no consistent trends, although there is a slight tendency for 10-12 y males to make up less of the 10-12 y pupil population than the proportion of males in the whole pupil population. The losses of pupils from Standard 3 to Standard 4 are always low, generally less than 10%. During the late 1880s the losses of pupils from Standard 4 to Standard 5 were greater than the losses from Standard 5 to Standard 6, and this pattern was also seen from the mid-1890s.

Westland Age and gender While there are marked fluctuations in the 5-6 y/7-9 y ratios, the overall trends for the male and female ratios are similar. A decline in the early 1880s, possibly related to declining fertility, is followed by a period until the mid-1890s when the ratio is relatively stable for both genders. In the later 1890s the ratio for females drops below that for males before rising at the turn of the century. After 1900 there are more marked fluctuations for both genders.

During the 1880s there was a marked increase in the ratio of 13-14 y/7-9 y pupils, both males and females (Fig. 52). At this time the ratio for females was greater than the ratio for males. During the early 1890s the ratios for both genders stabilised at about 55% and there was little difference between the genders. After 1893 the ratio for females decreased to about 45% in 1895 before rising again to peak in 1901 at about 75% and then falling greatly to about 28% in 1907 before increasing again to settle at about 38%.

Fig. 52 ­ Westland Education District: Ratios for male and female pupils aged 5-6 y and 13-14 y in the numerator, and aged 7-9 y in the denominator, 1880­1911 (calculated from various E-1 Reports) For males the ratio remained reasonably constant during the 1890s at about 55% before rising slightly to a peak in 1902 of about 62% before falling through the early years of the new century until 1905 when the ratio was about 40%. The ratio for males remained at this level until 1908 when it rose to about 48% in 1910 before falling once again to about 38%. During the 1890s the ratio for females was below that for males. This pattern changed between 1899 and 1902 when the ratio for females was considerably greater than for males. From 1902 to 1905 the ratio for males and females was similar but after 1905 the ratio for females was again generally lower than the ratio for males except for 1908.

These results indicate that there were more females in the 13-14 y age group in the 1880s and for a brief time at the turn of the century. At other time there were generally fewer females in this age group than there were males suggesting that females in the 13-14 y age group were leaving school at an earlier age than males.

90 When individual constructed age cohorts are considered, there are few obvious trends. In the 1882 there were slightly fewer males in all age groups (Fig. 53) and, because of the reciprocity of the genders, slightly more females in all age groups (Fig. 54).The male cohort starting in 1895 also had slightly fewer members and the cohort starting in 1900 had slightly more male members; there were corresponding trends for females.

One point of interest for this Education District is that the males and females attending school were almost equal in proportion which is generally not the case in most other Education Districts. Standards levels The ratio of observed to expected pupils in various Standards shows great fluctuations for all three Standards under consideration (Fig. 55). The sharp decrease in the ratio for all three Standards in 1885 is the result of the setting up of the new Grey Education District. There are no clear patterns and trends in the observed to expected ratios for all three Standards that can be discerned.

However, when the observed pupil numbers in each of the three Standards is considered separately, some patterns can be seen (Fig. 56). During the late 1880s there was an increased loss of pupils from Standard 4 to Standard 5 and a similar trend is seen during the 1890s. From 1897 until 1900 there is an increased loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 with a sharp increase to almost 40% from 1900 to 1902 before the level recovers again in 1903 to about 18%.

For Standard 6 the loss remains relatively static until the mid-1890s at around 35%. After 1895 the loss from Standard 5 to Standard 6 declines until 1901. There is a sharp increase in loss in 1902 to over 30% before the loss from Standard 5 to Standard 6 becomes erratic again.

A consideration of individual constructed Standards cohorts shows no clear patterns of loss among the various Standards (Fig. 57) and for a number of cohorts during the nineteenth century there is even an increase in pupils between Standard 4 and Standard 5 over the expected number. A similar occurrence is seen for pupils moving

from Standard 5 to Standard 6 around the turn of the century where there was a greater number of pupils in Standard 6 than was calculated from the previous Standard. Some of these increased Standard 5 and Standard 6 numbers may be related to the District High Schools that operated in the area such as the Kumara District High School which operated in the late 1890s (Hodder, 1997).

Fig. 57 ­ Westland Education District: The percentage changes between Standards 3 and 4, between Standards 4 and 5, and between Standards 5 and 6. Each line represents a single constructed cohort starting in Standard 3; the length of the line between points indicates the percentage loss between successive Standards ­ the longer the line, the greater the loss (calculated from E-1 reports) There are no clear gender differences for the 5-6 y or the 13-14 y age groups during the years being studied. Also, there are no clear trends seen for the derived age cohorts.

The losses of pupils between successive Standards levels are variable during the 1880s. During the 1890s the losses from Standard 5 to Standard 6 are greater than the losses from Standard 4 to Standard 5. Around the beginning of the twentieth century this pattern becomes more variable but generally the losses from Standard 4 to Standard 5 are greater than the losses from Standard 5 to Standard 6.

North Canterbury Age and gender The ratio of pupils 5-6 y/7-9 y is similar for both genders. There is a decline in the ratios during the 1880s but then the ratios remain stable at just above 0.5, rising closer to 0.6 after the beginning of the new century.

The ratio then remains relatively stable until 1903 after which the ratio for males increases slightly with a more marked increase from 1907 to 1909; for females the ratio remains relatively stable until 1907 after which is rises as for males. During most of the period under consideration there is little difference between the ratio for males and that for females. However, from 1903 the ratio for females is lower than that for males in the 13-14 y age group. It is suggested that this may be because females in this age group were leaving school at an earlier age than males.

Individual age cohorts were created synthetically to follow pupils through the various age groups. For males in the first cohort there were few pupils in all three age groups than there were males in the total pupil population (Fig. 59). In the second cohort there were fewer males in the 13-14 y age group than in the total pupil population. For

Cohort 3 the proportion of males in the 13-14 y age group was greater than the proportion of males in the total pupil population, and in Cohort 4 there were more males in all three age groups than there were males in the total pupil population.

the same as Cohort 5, although the proportion of males in the oldest age group is considerably less than in Cohort 5. Because of the reciprocity of the proportion of each gender, the patterns seen for the female cohorts are the converse of the patterns seen for the male cohorts (Fig. 60).

Fig. 61 ­ North Canterbury Education District: Ratio of observed pupil numbers to expected pupil numbers for Standards 4, 5 and 6 (Source: E-1 Reports) It is not possible to determine from this study whether it is the males or the females that are causing the changes in the ratios within certain cohorts. A high ratio for males the oldest age group may result from males remaining at school into this age group or from females leaving school before reaching this age group. Standards levels The ratio of observed to expected pupil numbers in Standard 4 shows a steady rise, with a few fluctuations, from about 70% in the early 1880s to about 95% by the first years of the new century (Fig. 61). The rise during the 1880s was relatively steep and the rise during the remaining years of the nineteenth century was slower. For Standard 5 the observed to expected ratio fluctuated markedly during the 1880s although there is an overall trend to a slight increase in the ratio which rises from about 70% in 1881 to just under 80% in 1889 (Fig. 61). The ratio remains relatively static during the first part of the 1890s between about 75% and 80%; during the middle years of the 1890s there was a marked increase in the Standard 5 ratio from about 75% to about 85%. From the mid-1890s the ratio for Standard 5 remained relatively stable, fluctuating around about 85%.

Each line represents a single constructed cohort starting in Standard 3; the length of the line between points indicates the percentage loss between successive Standards ­ the longer the line, the greater the loss (calculated from E-1 reports)

101 The ratio of observed to expected rose quite markedly, although with some fluctuations, during the 1880s, rising from about 45% to over 70%. However, the ratio decreased in the last 2 years of the 1880s to about 65% (Fig. 61). During the 1890s the Standard 6 ratio increased more slowly, rising to just over 80% in 1895. There was then little change in the Standard 6 ratio, which fluctuated around 80%.

The % change between successive Standards shows a steep increase as well as some fluctuations for all three levels during the first half of the 1880s (Fig. 62). From 1886 the % change for Standard 4 shows a steady rise from about 35% to reach about 5% in 1893 and about 0% in 1897, after which the ratio fluctuated slightly just below 5%.

For Standard 5 the % change from 1890 increased steadily but with some plateaus, from about 35% to reach just over 10% by 1902.

For Standard 6, after fluctuating during the early 1880s, the ratio rose quite steeply during the first half of the 1890s, rising from just over 50% to just over 30%. The Standard 6 % change then fluctuated close to 30% for the remaining time.

A study of individual constructed Standard cohorts shows little in the way of a pattern during the 1880s and the first half of the 1890s (Fig. 63). From the mid-1890s, however, a trend emerges with greater loss between Standard 4 and Standard 5 than between Standard 5 and Standard 6. This pattern lasts until the turn of the century, after which the trend tends to reverse, with a greater loss between Standard 5 and Standard 6 than between Standard 4 and Standard 5.

Summary for North Canterbury Education District There are no gender differences for the 5-6 y and 13-14 y age groups. There are also no large deviations in the derived age cohorts for males and females, although during the late 1890s and into the first decade of the twentieth century there is a tendency for more males in the 13-14 y age group than are seen in the whole pupil population. Similarly, there are fewer females at this time in this age group than in the whole pupil population.

102 The losses of pupils between Standard 3 and Standard 4 are high during the 1880s, but the losses fall to about 20% by 1890 and fall further to be below 10% by the mid1890s. During the 1880s the losses from Standard 4 to Standard 5 and from Standard 5 to Standard 6 are variable. During the early 1890s the losses from Standard 4 to Standard 5 and from Standard 5 to Standard 6 are similar but from the mid-1890s until the turn of the century the losses are greater from Standard 4 to Standard 5 than from Standard 5 to Standard 6. After the turn of the century this pattern changes with the losses being greater from Standard 5 to Standard 6 than from Standard 4 to Standard 5.

South Canterbury Age and gender The ratio 5-6 y/7-9 y for both males and females fluctuates but both genders follow a similar trend. There is a decline in the ratios during the 1880s, possibly related to a decline in fertility, and then the ratio for both genders, while fluctuating somewhat, remains between 0.5 and 0.6 for the remainder of the time period under consideration.

104 The ratio for 13-14 y/7-9 y males and females shows little change during the 1880s; this ratio rises for both genders during the early 1890s before plateauing until the turn of the century (Fig. 64). The ratio rises and falls during the first decade of the twentieth century. During the nineteenth century the ratios for males and females are at similar levels. From 1900 the ratio for females is lower than that for males until 1911 when the ratio for females rises above that for males. Leading up to the crossover in 1911 between male and female ratios, the ratio for females from 1908 increases steadily; at the same time the ratio for males show a slight decrease.

The lower female ratio from the start of the twentieth century suggests that females were tending to leave school at an earlier age than males. From the constructed individual age cohorts the proportion of each gender in the three age groups was compared to the proportion of each gender in the entire school population. For males, Cohorts 1 and 2 have the proportion of male pupils aged 1314y well above the proportion of males in the total pupil population (Fig. 65). For Cohorts 2, 3, 4 and 6 the proportion of males in the two lower age groups is below the proportion of males in the overall pupil population. For Cohort 4 the proportion of males in the 13-14y age group is greater than the proportion of males in the total pupil population; but in Cohorts 5 and 6 the proportion of males in the 13-14y age group is below the proportion of males in the total pupil population.

These results suggest that for Cohorts 1 and 2 (and possibly Cohort 4) there were more males aged 13-14 y than would have been expected. By contrast, from the mid1880s to the turn of the century there were also fewer males age 7-9 y and 10-12 y. These data suggest that males were remaining at school into the 13-14 y age group more than would be expected. The pattern changed for Cohort 6 where all age groups have a lower proportion of males than expected suggesting that males were now leaving school at an earlier age group.

Because of the reciprocity of the gender proportions in each age group, the cohorts for female pupils show the opposite trend to males. During the 1880s the proportion of

population. The proportion of females in the three age groups in Cohort 5 is close to the proportion of females in the total school population. For Cohort 6 the proportion of females in all three age groups is above the proportion of females in the total

107 school population. This suggests that either males were leaving school earlier in this cohort or females were remaining at school longer in this cohort.

Standards levels The ratio of observed to expected pupils in Standard 4 fluctuates during the early and mid-1880s and then remains just above 60% until 1893 when the ratio declines to around 60% (Fig. 67). After 1898 the ratio decreases to reach 46% in 1901 before rising again to just below 60% in 1903. This trend downwards after the turn of the century suggests that more pupils were leaving school before completing Standard 4 than had been the case in the nineteenth century.

The ratio of observed to expected pupils in Standard 5 decreases during the first half of the 1880s and then rises sharply in 1886 before dropping back until 1888 (Fig. 67). The ratio then remained relatively stable until 1893, at about 70%. From 1893 to 1895 the ratio increased to about 90% and then fluctuated between 80% and 90% until 1899. After 1899 the ratio for Standard 5 increased slowly before stabilising at just over 90% in 1902.

Fig. 68 ­ South Canterbury Education District: Percentage change between Standards 3 and 4, between Standards 4 and 5, and between Standards 5 and 6, for yearly cohorts starting in Standard 3 (calculated from E-1 reports)

The ratio of observed to expected pupils in Standard 6 fluctuated throughout the nineteenth century, after decreasing during the first half of the 1880s (Fig. 67). There was a brief period of stability in the early 1890s before the ratio once again fluctuated, stabilising after 1902 at close to 80%.

These ratios show an unexpected decline in Standard 4 attendance which could suggest that pupils were leaving school before completing this level of schooling perhaps to undertake employment either from necessity (to help with family finances) or because there was increasing employment opportunities available in this period.

The % change between Standard 3 and Standard 4 shows an initial increase until 1888, from less than 20% to close to 30% loss (Fig. 68). From 1888 to 1890 the loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4 decreased markedly from close to 30% to about 12%. The loss then remained stable at this level until 1895, when the loss again reduced until the turn of the century when there was little loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4.

Fig. 69 ­ South Canterbury Education District: The percentage changes between Standards 3 and 4, between Standards 4 and 5, and between Standards 5 and 6. Each line represents a single constructed cohort starting in Standard 3; the length of the line between points indicates the percentage loss between successive Standards ­ the longer the line, the greater the loss (calculated from E-1 reports) After the turn of the century the loss fluctuated, but was never greater than 8%.

The % change from Standard 4 to Standard 5 increased sharply during the early 1880s, dropping from about 35% loss to over 50% loss in 1885 (Fig. 68). The loss then dropped equally sharply, from over 50% in 1885 to 30% in 1887. The loss then stabilised until 1891, dropped slightly again in 1892 and 1893, before rising and fluctuating between 25% and 20% until 1898. After 1898 the loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 dropped markedly so that by 1901 the loss was only about 5% and remained at this level for the remainder of the period. The % change from Standard 5 to Standard 6 fluctuated during the 1880s between 40% and 50% loss (Fig. 68). After 1889 the % change decreased markedly until 1894, when it was below 30%. During the second half of the 1890s the % change fluctuated markedly and then reduced by 1900 to below 20%. The % change then fluctuated around 20% loss for the remainder of the period.

110 The study of individual constructed cohorts shows that until the mid-1880s there was a greater loss between Standard 4 and Standard 5 than between Standard 5 and Standard 6 (Fig. 69). From 1886 to 1889 the pattern changed and the loss was greater between the two highest standards. From 1890 the pattern changed again, with greater loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 than from Standard 5 to Standard 6; this pattern lasted until 1893. From 1893 to 1896 there was similar loss from both levels. From 1896 to 1900 the loss was greater from Standard 4 to Standard 5 than from Standard 5 to Standard 6. After the turn of the century the loss was once again greater from Standard 5 to Standard 6 than from Standard 4 to Standard 5.

There are few clear patterns for this Education District, although the loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4 shows an initial increase until the mid-1880s and then gradually the loss diminishes over time so that by the end of the nineteenth century there was little loss between these two Standards.

Summary for South Canterbury Education District The age ratios for this Education District vary without showing a consistent difference between the genders for the 5-6 y and 13-14 y age groups. For the derived age cohorts there is a higher proportion of males in the 13-14 y age group during the later 1880s and early 1890s than is seen for the total pupil population; similarly, the proportion of females is lower at this time. Generally the proportion of males in the 7-9 y and 10-12 y age groups is slightly lower than the proportion of males in the total pupil population during the nineteenth century and, similarly, the opposite is seem for females in these age groups.

During the early 1880s the losses of pupils from Standard 4 to Standard 5 is greater than the losses from Standard 5 to Standard 6. During the late 1880s this pattern is reversed, but the earlier pattern returns during the early 1890s. During the late 1890s the losses from Standard 4 to Standard 5 are similar to the losses from Standard 5 to Standard 6, but just before the turn of the century there is a brief change with losses being greater from Standard 4 to Standard 5 than fro Standard 5 to Standard 6. From the early 1900s the losses from Standard 5 to Standard 6 are greater than from Standard 4 to Standard 5.

111 Otago Age and gender There is little difference between the 5-6 y/7-9 y ratios for males and females. During the early 1880s there is a small decline in both gender ratios, although this is much less marked than in other Education Districts. From the mid-1880s until the beginning of the twentieth century the ratios remain remarkably stable at close to 0.5. After the turn of the century the ratios slowly rise to just below 0.6.

The ratio of males and females 13-14 y/7-9 y is just below 0.3 and shows little change until 1886. After 1886 the ratio for both males and females shows in increase, but the increase is greater for males, rising from 30% in 1886 to about 43% in 1893 and remaining close to 40% until 1898 (Fig. 70). After 1898 the ratio for males decreased until 1905 when it had declined to 35%. In the following two years it increased to close to 45% before dropping back to below 40%.

For females the ratio increased less, rising from about 28% in 1887 to about 35% in 1893. It remained at this level until 1898 and then fluctuated between about 30% and

males. This indicates there were fewer older age females than older males. During this time the ratio of younger pupils remained relatively constant and so the difference between males and females in the 13-14 y age group suggests that females may have left school before the age of 13 y in greater numbers than males perhaps for employment reasons or to help in the home.

115 Constructed age cohorts show that in all cohorts except Cohort 1 the proportion of males in the oldest age group is well above the proportion of males in the total pupil population, although the difference is less in Cohort 6 than in the previous four cohorts (Fig. 71). Except in Cohort 1, the proportion of males in the two younger age groups is close to the proportion of males in the total pupil population.

For females the trends described for males is reversed. For Cohorts 2 to 6 the proportion of females in the oldest age group is considerably lower than the proportion of females in the total pupil population (Fig. 72). The results from these constructed age cohorts suggest that from the mid-1880s until after the turn of the century either females were leaving school before age 13 y or that males were staying at school until they reached 14 y. Because of the reciprocity of the ratios, it is not possible to distinguish which of these is correct.

Standards levels The ratio of observed to expected pupil numbers for Standard 4 shows only a slight increase over the time period, being mostly around 90% in the nineteenth century and increasing slightly just before the turn of the century, before returning to previous levels and then rising slowly after 1900 to close to 100% by 1904 (Fig. 73).

For Standard 5 the observed to expected ratio initially fluctuates and then remains close to 80% until the early 1890s (Fig. 73). The ratio rises slightly during the early 1890s and then plateaus from the later 1890 at about 90%.

For Standard 6 the ratio fluctuates during the first half of the 1880s, declines slightly from 1887 to 1890, increases slightly from 1890 to 1892 and then remains close to 80% until the turn of the century, after which the ratio fluctuates but trends downwards (Fig. 73). These results show that through the time period there were only slight changes in the ratio of pupils in each of the three Standards with few obvious trends.

117 The % change between Standard 3 and Standard 4 decreases slowly during the nineteenth century, starting at about 18% and, apart from a peak in 1896-1897, the % change settles around about 5% (Fig. 74).

For Standard 5 the % change decreases markedly in the mid-1880s from about 35% to about 20% (Fig. 74). This level is maintained until 1894 when there is a slight decrease in the % change to about 17%. The % change reduces again from about 18% in 1899 to less than 10% in 1901, after which the level remains static.

For Standard 6 there is a general trend to a reduction in the % change from Standard 5 to Standard 6, the % change rising from about 45% loss to just under 30% loss (Fig. 74). From the turn of the century the % change decrease a little and fluctuated at about 25%.

Overall these results suggest that over the time period there was a general increase in the retention of pupils from Standard 3 through Standards 4 and Standard 5 to Standard 6.

118 Individual constructed cohorts show a change in the pattern of retention between the higher Standards. Until the mid-1880s there was a greater loss between Standard 4 and Standard 5 than between Standard 5 and Standard 6 (Fig. 75). This pattern changed in the second half of the 1880s with greater loss of pupils between Standard 5 and Standard 6 than between Standard 4 and Standard 5. From 1890 until the end of the century the pattern changed again, with greater loss between Standard 4 and Standard 5 than between Standard 5 and Standard 6. After the turn of the century the pattern reversed, with greater loss between the two highest Standards.

Summary for Otago Education District For the 5-6 y age group there are no clear gender differences. However, there is a clear difference in the gender patterns for the 13-14 y age group, with the ratio for males being greater than that for females from the mid-1880s until the early years of the first decade of the twentieth century. This pattern is also seen in the derived cohorts where the proportion of males in the 13-14 y age group is greater than the proportion of males in the whole pupil population during the 1890s and in the first decade of the twentieth century. Similarly, the proportion of females in this age group is lower than the proportion of females in the total pupil population.

The loss of pupils from Standard 4 to Standard 5 is greater than the loss of pupils from Standard 5 to Standard 6 during the early 1880s, but this pattern is reversed during the late 1880s before the first pattern returns during the 1890s. After the turn of the century the pattern changes once more, with the loss of pupils being greater from Standard 5 to Standard 6 than from Standard 4 to Standard 5.

Southland Age and gender Both males and females have a similar pattern for the ratio 5-6 y/7-9 y. An initial decline in the early 1880s is followed by a long period when the ratio for both genders remains relatively constant at just above 0.5, rising slightly from the early 1900s. The ratios for males and females 13-14 y/7-9 y show a slight decrease in the early 1880s and then rises slightly in the late 1880s (Fig. 76). During the 1890s there is little change for the male and female ratios. From 1898 the male ratio fluctuates

119 somewhat until it plateaus in 1903 remaining relatively static until 1907 when the ratio increases and then falls again. For females the ratio is similar to that for males until 1898 (Fig. 76). Between 1897 and 1899 the ratio declines slightly and then fluctuates close to 30% until 1905, after which it rises to settle at about 35%. After 1894 the ratio for females is consistently lower than that for males, suggesting that fewer females remained at school when aged 13-14y than was the case for males.

When constructed age cohorts are considered, there are more 7-9 y males in Cohort 1 than in the total pupil population and fewer 13-14 y males (Fig. 77). For Cohort 2 there were fewer 10-12 y and 13-14 y males than in the total pupil population. For Cohort 3 there were more young (7-9 y) and older (13-14 y) males than in the total pupil population. For Cohort 4 the proportion of males is lower in the 10-12 y age group and higher in the 13-14 y age group. In Cohort 5 the proportion of males in the 13-14 y age group is markedly higher, while the proportion in the two lower age groups is the same as in the total pupil population.

Cohorts 1 and 2 contrasts with that in Cohorts 3, 4, 5, and 6 where the proportion of females is always below the proportion of females in the total pupil population (Fig. 78). These data suggest that from the 1890s either there was a trend for males to remain at school into the 13-14 y age group or that there was a trend for females to leave school before reaching this age group.

123 Standards levels The ratio of observed to expected for the three highest Standards all fluctuate during the first half of the 1880s (Fig. 79). The ratio changes only slightly over the remaining time period, with the ratio for Standard 5 showing a slight general increase from about 75% to just over 85%.

The % change between Standards shows a general decrease in the loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4 during the nineteenth century until the mid-1890s, rising from a loss of about 30% to a loss of less than 10% (Fig. 80). From the mid-1890s the loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4 settled at less than 10%.

The % change from Standard 4 to Standard 5 fluctuated during the first half of the 1880s and then decreased sharply between 1886 and 1887 from close to 60% to less than 35% (Fig. 80). From 1888 there is a steady decrease in the % change from Standard 4 to Standard 5 until the % change settles at about 10% in 1902. The % change from Standard 5 to Standard 6 fluctuates markedly during the 1880s (Fig. 80). From 1889 to 1891 there is a marked decrease in the % change, dropping from almost 60% loss to close to 40% loss. During the first half of the 1890s the % change from Standard 5 to Standard 6 remained stable. Between 1895 and 1896 the % change decreased by about 5% and then remained stable until 1899. After 1899 the % change from Standard 5 to Standard 6 became much more erratic, with a tendency towards an overall decrease.

Constructed individual Standard level cohorts show changes in the pattern of pupil loss between successive Standards. Before 1885 the trend is for greater loss between Standard 4 and Standard 5 than between Standard 5 and Standard 6 (Fig. 81). Between 1885 and 1890 the trend is reversed, with greater loss between Standard 5 and Standard 6 than between Standard 4 and Standard 5. From 1890 to 1893 the trend reverses again, and after 1892 the pattern once again shows greater loss between Standard 4 and Standard 5 than between Standard 5 and Standard 6. From 1898 there is once again a reverse of this trend which persists in the twentieth century.

Summary for Southland Education District No consistent gender differences are seen for the 5-6 y age group during the years under consideration. For the 13-14 y age group the ratio of males is greater than the ratio for females from the mid-1890s until the middle of the first decade of the twentieth century. During the first decade of the twentieth century the proportion of males in the 13-14 y age group is greater than the proportion of males in the whole pupil population and, similarly, the proportion of females in this age group is lower than the proportion of females in the whole pupil population.

Until the late 1880s the loss of pupils was greater between Standard 4 and Standard 5 than between Standard 5 and Standard 6. During the late 1880s and early 1890s this pattern was reversed before the original pattern returned during the early 1890s and remained until the end of the century. From the late 1890s the losses between Standard 4 and Standard 5 and between Standard 5 and Standard 6 were similar.

Chapter 5 Summary of Findings and Conclusions Summary of findings
1. Age ratios Two age ratios (5-6 y/7-9 y and 13-14 y/7-9 y) were studied to analyse any trends in increased or decreased attendance of pupils at the new entrant level and at the school leaver level.

For many of the Education Districts the ratio for the younger pupils was about 0.5. If this ratio increases over time it indicates that there were more younger pupils attending school as was seen, for example, in Taranaki towards the turn of the twentieth century. This could indicate that younger children were being sent to school more often than in earlier years and that such children attended school more regularly. In addition, a high ratio for this younger age group may indicate a different structure of the population where a younger population of adults will be in the early years of childbearing thereby swelling the ranks of young school-aged children. This could explain, for example, the high ratios seen in Education Districts on the West Coast of the South Island (particularly Grey and Westland).

Typically in many Education Districts the ratio for younger pupils declined during the 1880s as more pupils attended school with greater regularity, particularly those in the 7-9 y age group (since the pupils in this category comprise the denominator of the calculated ratio). During the 1890s the ratio for the younger pupils generally stabilised in many of the Education Districts.

The results of this study do not indicate significant differences for males and females in school attendance for the younger pupils although the data are often somewhat "noisy" in the early 1880s. In a few Education Districts (for example, Marlborough, Grey, Westland and South Canterbury) the fluctuations continue through most of the late nineteenth century.

For the older school-leaver age group of pupils, many of the Education Districts have a ratio of about 0.35. Over the time period under consideration this ratio often tends to rise slowly until the beginning of the twentieth century. This rise indicates that more

128 older pupils are remaining at school and/or are attending more regularly through the nineteenth century. However, there are a number of Education Districts where the ratio plateaus or even declines after the beginning of the twentieth century, for example Auckland, Taranaki, Nelson, Grey and North Canterbury.

An additional finding for the ratio 13-14 y to 7-9 y pupils is the gender difference that is clear in some of the Education Districts. For example, in the Auckland Education District the ratio for females is higher than for males throughout the nineteenth century but the ratios cross over at the beginning of the twentieth century and the ratio for males is higher than that for females. These results indicate that either more males than females were remaining at school until the 13-14 y age group, or that more girls were leaving school from this age group, perhaps because they had reached the level of exemption (Standard 5) and so could legitimately leave school either to join the paid workforce or to work in the home without payment. For the Taranaki Education District there are also gender differences similar to those seen in Auckland. In a number of Education Districts some gender differences appear after the beginning of the twentieth century, for example, in Wanganui, Marlborough, North Canterbury and South Canterbury. In the Otago Education District there is a clear gender difference from the mid 1880s through until about 1907 during which time the ratio for males in consistently above that for females for the 13-14 y age group.

2. Male and female age cohorts In many of the Education Districts the proportion of males in the school population is about 0.52 and thus the proportion of females is about 0.48. These results indicate the there were more males than females in the school population (as has been noted by Cumming, 1981). However, in some Education Districts this pattern does not apply. For example, in Grey the proportion of males during the nineteenth century is consistently below 0.5 and declines even further about the turn of the twentieth century, before rising to reach about 0.52 at the end of the first decade of the twentieth century. The ratio for females in the Grey Education District is the converse of that for males. It is not possible to say from these results whether it is the male pupil population or the female pupil population that is the cause of these gender differences.

129 The constructed age cohorts show a variety of trends. These cohorts aim to follow the same group of pupils from the 7-9 y age group into the 13-14 y age group and to compare the proportion of each gender in each age group with the overall proportion of each gender in the school population at that time. The greatest variation is seen for the third point for each cohort, i.e., the pupils that are in the 13-14 y age group. The proportion of each gender in the constructed cohorts in this age group is often the furthest from the proportion of each gender in the total pupil population at that time. One pattern that is seen in a number of Education Districts is the lower ratio of 13-14y males in the 1880s and early 1890s (and a corresponding high ratio for females in this age group), but by the first decade of the twentieth century the pattern is reversed and the ratio for males is greater than for females for this age group; this pattern is seen for Auckland and Taranaki. In some other Education Districts the gender difference does not become clear until the end of the nineteenth century when the proportion of males rises above the proportion of males in the total pupil population and conversely the proportion of females drops below that in the total pupil population. This pattern is seen in North Canterbury and Southland. In the Otago Education District this pattern is extended so that the proportion of females in the 13-14 y age group is below that for the total pupil population from the 1890s.

3. Standards ratio for observed to expected pupil numbers For the time period under consideration, for most Education Districts the trend for the three highest Standards (Standards 4, 5, and 6) is to rise from the late 1880s into the early years of the twentieth century. Commonly the ratio for Standard 4 rises from about 0.8 or so to at least 0.9. For Standard 5 the ratio commonly rises from about 0.7 to about 0.8 or higher. For Standard 6 the ratio often starts at about 0.6 and rises to about 0.7. Some Education Districts show considerable variation in the Standards ratios, for example Standard 4 in Hawke's Bay varies considerably during the nineteenth century. The same pattern is seen in Taranaki for Standard 5. In some Education Districts there is considerable variation for all three Standards, for example, in Marlborough and Westland. A few Education Districts stand out with a clearly different pattern: in Hawke's Bay the ratio for Standard 6 is very much lower than in other Education Districts, starting in the 1880s around 0.2 and only reaching 0.6 after the beginning of the twentieth century; and in South Canterbury the ratio for Standard 4 is about 0.7 and declines to below 0.6 by the end of the 1890s.

130 4. Percentage change in Standards ratio The percentage change from a Standard to the succeeding Standard is an indication of the extent of loss of pupils between the two Standards. Analyses were carried out separately for the three highest Standards. Since there was loss from most Standards from the number of pupils in the preceding Standard, the results are all shown as negative. However, in most Education Districts there is a general trend for the loss from each Standard to reduce during the nineteenth century (i.e., the graphs of the percentage changes become less negative). In most Education Districts the percentage change from Standard 3 to Standard 4 rises to close to zero by the early 1890s. The loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 plateaus in the 1890s at around 25% (for example, Auckland and Otago) or continues to rise through into the twentieth century (for example, North Canterbury and Southland). For some Education Districts the loss from successive Standards is quite variable and "noisy", although the general trend tends to be a reduction in the loss of pupils (for example, Westland).

Generally the loss from Standard 5 to Standard 6 is greater than that from Standard 4 to Standard 5 which in turn is greater than the loss from Standard 3 to Standard 4.

5. Percentage change in successive Standards for individual cohorts The study of successive cohorts passing through the higher Standards reveals a similar pattern in many of the Education Districts. Up to the early 1880s losses tend to be quite variable, with often large losses between Standard 3 and Standard 4. During the 1880s the losses from Standard 5 to Standard 6 are generally greater than the losses from Standard 4 to Standard 5. During the 1890s this trend is reversed, with losses from Standard 4 to Standard 5 being greater than from Standard 5 to Standard 6. After the beginning of the twentieth century the pattern changes again; the losses from Standard 5 to Standard 6 are again greater than the losses from Standard 4 to Standard 5.

Some Education Districts show variations of the described general pattern given in the preceding paragraph. Thus for example, in Hawke's Bay and Grey the losses from Standard 5 to Standard 6 were generally always greater than the losses from Standard 4 to Standard 5. In a number of the South Island Education Districts (for example, South Canterbury, Otago, Southland) in the early 1880s the loss from Standard 4 to

131 Standard 5 was greater than the loss from Standard 5 to Standard 6. The changes seen in the losses for succeeding cohorts give an indication of the level of attainment at which pupils were leaving school. The changes described here would need to be investigated further but may indicate the influence of changes in the economy and thus employment prospects for school leavers, particularly as a regional level.

Conclusions
1. Age and pupil attendance For the 5-6 y age group there is generally a rise in the ratio to the 7-9 y age group, which indicates that there were increasing numbers of younger children attending the schools. In some areas in the South Island (for example, the West Coast, Grey, Nelson and Marlborough Education Districts) the ratio of younger pupils is high which may indicate that the populations in these areas had a different structure from those in perhaps more urban and established areas. It may also indicate that the population into these areas consisted of young adults in the early years of childbearing. This may be because of regional economic changes such as coal mining or forestry. In one Education District (Marlborough) the ratio of younger pupils was very low and may indicate a particular regional issue, for example children required to help on dairy farms: since children were only required to attend school from the age of 7 years, young children may have been working on family farms such as milking cows.

For the 13-14 y age group, the rise in this ratio would indicate that increasing numbers of pupils were staying at school longer, leading to an aging of the pupil population. Throughout the country there was a general trend for the ratio of 13-14 y pupils to increase, although in the north of the South Island and on the West Coast the pattern was quite variable.

There were few gender differences revealed in this study for the 5-6 y age group. However, for the 13-14 y age group there were some clear gender differences at certain times. The changes in the gender patterns warrants further study ­ why, for example, did the ratio for females fall below that for males in a number of Education Districts at the turn of the twentieth century?

132 The proportion of males to females in the pupil population through the nineteenth century and into the first decade of the twentieth century shows that generally there were more males than females in the pupil population. However, there were exceptions where the proportion of males was less than that of females (for example, Westland and Grey). This gender difference has been explained in the literature as resulting from girls starting school at an older age and attending less regularly (Fry 1985, p.9). Alternatively, the ratios in the various Education Districts may be because of employment of males in mining or forestry, but this would need to be investigated on a regional basis.

The gender balance varies among the various Education Districts for the 13-14 y age group. In many of the Education Districts there appears to be a change in female retention in this older age group around the turn of the twentieth century, with either females leaving school in greater numbers than males or males remaining at school in greater numbers than females. This aspect of school attendance would need more detailed investigation to determine the cause of this change.

2. Standards of schooling The ratio of observed to expected pupils in the higher Standards shows similar trends in many Education Districts with generally all three Standards showing a rise in the ratio over the time period under consideration. The predominant pattern is for the ratio for Standard 4 to be higher that that for Standard 5 which is higher than for Standard 6. However, there are some variations from this pattern. Some Education Districts show a very low ratio for Standard 6 which, again, could be investigated in light of the economy of a region and employment prospects for school leavers. One Education District (South Canterbury) shows an unusual pattern for the ratio for Standard 4, with this ratio decreasing rather than increasing. Again this region's economy may have influenced either school attendance or school leaving.

The calculated percentage change for the pupils remaining in successive Standards or, in effect, the loss of pupils between successive Standards generally trends upwards, indicating that fewer pupils were leaving between the higher Standards as the nineteenth century drew to a close. However, in some South Island Education Districts (Nelson, Grey, Westland) the trend was for less pupil loss from Standard 3 to

133 Standard 4 compared to many North Island Districts; and in Westland the loss of pupils from Standard 4 to Standard 5 was also low in the 1890s. The reasons for these differences in pupil loss would need to be further investigated by studying the individual regions. One possible area of future research is the effect of the District High Schools that operated on the West Coast may have had an influence on pupils remaining at school.

The percentage change for individual constructed cohorts (which follow the same pupils through the higher Standards) shows that from the 1880s to the 1890s generally the loss was greater form Standard 5 to Standard 6 than from Standard 4 to Standard 5. However, in the South Island the pattern differs somewhat with the loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 being greater than the loss from Standard 5 to Standard 6 until the mid 1880s. In the 1890s there was a change in many Education Districts with greater loss from Standard 4 to Standard 5 than from Standard 5 to Standard 6. Around the turn of the twentieth century there is once again a change in the pattern, with losses being greater from Standard 5 to Standard 6 than from Standard 4 to Standard 5. Previous writings have suggested that there was a gradual lengthening of schooling for pupils both by age and also by the Standard level they achieved when they completed their schooling (Shuker, 1987, p.47). The results presented here indicate that the picture may be much more complex, with pupils perhaps leaving school to find employment as economic conditions dictated or as opportunities arose. Thus, at times pupils left school after completing Standard 4 and at other times pupils remained at school through to Standard 5 or even Standard 6. What is unexpected is that at the turn of the twentieth century there was a tendency for pupils to leave school with a lower Standard than in the 1890s.

Considering all the results presented in this thesis, it is clear that there were regional variations in education which need to be investigated further. In addition, the results presented here indicate that there were some perhaps unexpected changes in school attendance at the beginning of the twentieth century: girls aged 13-14 y were leaving in greater numbers than boys of the same age, or boys of this age were remaining at school longer than girls. In addition, there were clear changes in the pattern of pupils leaving school with lower Standards than in the previous decade. Further detailed studies, particularly at the regional level, would be needed to unravel the issues

134 behind these findings. It is suggested that there may be a link between the economy of a region and the school attendance patterns of pupils and complementary research could be needed to determine the destinations of pupils leaving the schools.

Finally, the combined effects of the 1899 Regulation that raised the level of exemption from Standard 4 to Standard 5 along with the 1901 School Attendance Act (which increased the number of times pupils had to attend school) may have had an effect on school attendance and thus be responsible for at least some of the changes seen around the turn of the century. How these changes affected school populations in various Education District may have varied and would require a detailed study of individual Education Districts.

Thus, further regional investigations could be conducted at the Education District level to determine the possible causes of the changes in the patterns of school attendance over the time period considered in this study. Of particular interest would be the period around the turn of the twentieth century, where there are clear changes in patterns of school attendance in many of the Education Districts. This period would warrant close study considering a number of aspects as noted above, covering legislation and regulations, employment prospects for school leavers, and social considerations such as views on the changing role and position of women in society.

Summary of conclusions and suggestions for further research
The results of the present study indicate that in most of the Education Districts, and thus in most areas of New Zealand, there were changes in the patterns of school attendance around the beginning of the twentieth century. Trends seen in all or most of the Education Districts may need to be explained on a nation-wide basis rather than on a regional basis. The various aspects of employment of school leavers would need to be studied along with possible social changes such as the notion of the "cult of domesticity" as outlined by some writers (Tennant, 1977; Novitz 1982). Thus, the patterns of school attendance and school retention must be explained in the context of the times.

135 The change in the exemption level in 1899 (which came into operation in 1900) may have accounted for some of the changes seen in Standards retention of pupils and the change in the pattern of retention seen around the turn of the twentieth century. This change in retention pattern, with lower percentage losses of pupils from Standard 4 to Standard 5 than from Standard 5 to Standard 6, was found in about half of the Education Districts (Auckland, Hawke's Bay, Wanganui, Wellington, North Canterbury, South Canterbury, Otago), but was not seen in the remaining Education Districts (Taranaki, Nelson, Grey, Westland, Southland).

The suggestion is made that the raising of the level of exemption had a much more noticeable effect of school pupil retention that the earlier legislation relating to how frequently pupils were required to attend school. This is the point that has been suggested by McKenzie (1982) and others, who note that the pattern of pupil attendance at schools preceded any changes in legislation. However, for some Education Districts different factors appear to have been operating and this may have been because of the type of employment available to school leavers in these regions; for example, school leavers may have worked principally on family farms of in family businesses if there were few industrial or professional jobs available.

In summary, the years at the beginning of the twentieth century need to be studied in more detail with employment opportunities for school leavers in various regions of New Zealand being a crucial part of this research. As part of this research, a study of the different opportunities for males and females must be considered along with variations in different regions.
