CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION
A Mori Perspective of Whnau and Childrearing in the 21st Century A Case Study of one Four Generational Family Te Whakapaki: Overview Within the context of family and childrearing, the Mori term `whnau' is so familiar to New Zealand society, yet so far reaching in its meaning and scope. Even within the context of this study and our four generation contemporary whnau, this scenario is evident. Each individual whnau member's lived experiences and relationships with people, places and things have contributed to their own perceptions and understandings of the concept of whnau and childrearing. This study sets out to explore individual and shared whnau member's perceptions and understandings about whnau and childrearing through a conscientising, cotheorising process to promote an informed approach to whnau and childrearing for our fourth generation whnau members 1 . For the purposes of this study, it is acknowledged that having information about historical Mori whnau and childrearing through whakapapa 2 and whnau, hapu and iwi stories will assist in desconstructing what is currently widely accepted as contemporary approaches to whnau and childrearing. The sharing of stories and subsequent deconstruction process provides whnau with an opportunity to reconstruct an approach that maximises benefits for not only our mokopuna, but all intergenerational whnau members.

Whnau e ai ki ng Kairangahau: Researcher's Perspectives According to Metge (1995); Pere (1994); and Walker (1990) whnau, historically (prior to contact with European), comprised an intergenerational unit based on whakapapa (descent from a common ancestor). The expectation was that each member of the whnau upheld responsibilities and obligations that contributed to the collective well-being of the unit (Durie in TeWhaiti, McCarthy and Durie, 1997; Metge, 1995; Pere, 1994; Rangihau, 1992; Buck, 1950; Walker, 1990). The philosophy of collective wellbeing meant that the `whnau' unit was committed to teaching and nurturing their young as an investment in their future. Each group of families was responsible for ensuring that all knowledge, collectively held by their group, was stored and accurately passed on to future generations. Whnau, hap and iwi ensured their prosperity by collectively nurturing and passing on to the children of the group tribal knowledge and skills (Buck, 1950; Eruera in Salmond, 1980; Pere, 1994; Walker, 1990). Te Ao Hurihuri: Contemporary Society Fundamental changes to the social structure of the traditional Mori whnau model occurred as a result of the impact of colonisation. Once colonial government was established, capitalism, industrialisation and urbanisation followed in rapid succession (Spoonley, in Mclennan, Ryan & Spoonley, 2000). These factors had a cumulative effect on the intergenerational whnau model. The nuclear family model displaced the Mori social model of kinship or whnau units because of its functional suitability to meet the needs of modern industrial society (Durie in Te Whaiti et al, 1997; Walker, 1990). The mobility of the nuclear family, the potential for independence, competitiveness and individualism was identified by social reformists as being necessary requirements of an industrial society (Spoonley in McLennan et al, 2000). From this perspective the intergenerational whnau model was considered an impediment to industrialisation as it philosophically worked for the collective benefit

2

of the whole, thereby working against competitiveness and individuality (Durie in Te Whaiti et al, 1997; Metge, 1995). Raupatu: Colonisation From a Mori perspective, the entire social structure of Mori society was disrupted. Any transition away from the intergenerational unit which focused on the holisitic wellbeing of the whnau, especially the care and education of children, would require intensive thought and strategic planning which involved whnau, hap and iwi to identify alternative support infrastructures. Mori knowledge, language and culture. Sociologists who have researched and recorded the diversity of the concept of family in non-Mori contexts, and made comparisons to the concept of whnau in Mori contexts, have argued that a criticism of the development of family policy in New Zealand is that it almost exclusively refers to the nuclear family, subjugating any cultural differences or alternative lifestyles as defective or inferior (KoopmanBoyden, 1987; Spoonley in Mclennan et al, 2000). Despite the literature available, family policy which impacts significantly on whnau in terms of housing, employment, health, social services, education (childcare and education services, school and tertiary), justice and virtually every aspect of our society, continues to be developed and costed out using the nuclear family model (Herbert, 2001; KoopmanBoyden, 1987; Metge, 1995; Ministerial Advisory Committee, 1986; Spoonley in Mclennan et al, 2000; Te Whaiti, McCarthy and Durie in Te Whaiti et al, 1997). The reluctance by government to acknowledge and appropriately address issues that have resulted from the planned fragmentation of Mori whnau, hap and iwi social infrastructures has meant that oral transmission of Mori knowledge from one generation to another, through carefully chosen repositories, has been interrupted. A consequence of that interruption means that many whnau do not have connections A reluctance to do so would surely jeopardise the wellbeing of Mori children and the intergenerational transmission of

Chapter One

with their marae kinships and many have not been taught iwi, hap and whnau whakapapa and histories. Such disassociation has contributed to the reality that the Mori language along with all its cultural values and ways of being and knowing, contributes to the decay of the every day spoken language (Benton & Benton, 2001; Bishop & Glynn, 1999). With the decay of their language, the Mori perspective of the world, including Mori epistemologies and philosophical perspectives and beliefs, are in danger of being lost. Without the collective practical support of the intergenerational whnau including all of the unit's historical pedagogies, many Mori children and their families are left exposed and vulnerable in the western capitalist society (Durie, in Te Whaiti et al, 1997; Metge, 1995). There is no doubt that the fragmentation of whnau and the absence of infrastructure support systems, present in the intergenerational whnau model, have contributed to the current status of the Mori child often highlighted in literature as `at risk' (Kiro, in Smith, Gollop, Marshall & Naim, 2000). Whnau/Tamariki e ai ki te Kawanatanga: Government Policies Since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, governments, and/or experts on their behalf, have defined through policy what is best for Mori (Durie, 1998; Jones, Marshall, Matthews,; Smith & Smith, 1990; Matahaere-Atariki, 2000; Murphy, 1994; Simon, 1998; Smith, 1994; Smith, 1997; Walker, 1990). Matahaere-Atariki (2000) speaks of the significant volume of literature which provides evidence of the educational under achievement of Mori. From it, she finds an irony that non Maori authors have the ability to define what is best for Mori, but yet these non-Mori experts continue to speak on behalf of Mori children theorising what constitutes their `best interests'. Tariana Turia, who at the time, was a Labour Party member of Parliament, 3 arugued in her speech to the seminar on children's policy (2000), that historically there has been no attempt to develop a policy on Mori children. She claims that the normal practice is to adopt an additive approach which involves

Chapter One

writing children's policy developed from a set of eurocentric values and beliefs which at times have been added to and interpreted as `a Mori perspective' (Turia, 2000). Mori continue to argue that Mori child policy should be based on whnau, hap and iwi forms of social organisation, values, beliefs and social processes. Central to the policy is the importance of whakapapa, the pre-eminence of the genealogical links between the child and his/her whanaunga including his/her ancestors and kaitiaki (Durie, 1998; Kiro in Smith et al, 2000; Matahaere-Atariki, 2000; Spoonley in McLennan et al, 2000; Turia, 2000). Ng Tumomo Whnau: Perspectives of Whnau Despite the unwillingness of the government to establish social and family policy inclusive of the intergenerational whnau model, it has been accepted and embraced extensively at other ecological levels which Bronfenbrenner (1979) describes as a model to which educators ought to aspire. In particular, the philosophy of reciprocity of benefit, underpinning the intergenerational model, has been readily accepted by many Mori and non-Mori groups and institutions within Aotearoa/New Zealand as an intervention strategy to establish and maintain networking and support infrastructures for those within the group (Metge, 1995; Smith, 1994; Te Khanga Reo, 1990). Such a perspective of whnau is known as the `metaphoric model'. While the metaphoric model often does not relate to whakapapa, it shares the philosophical aspirations of reciprocity of benefit for members of a group (Metge, 1995 et al). This context of whnau is explained later in chapter two. Essentially, the difference between the recorded traditional Mori kinship model of whnau (Buck, 1950; Durie in Te Whaiti et al, 1997; Metge, 1995) and the metaphoric model is the concept of choice in terms of commitment to responsibilities and obligations. The historical whnau model focussed on individuals within the group upholding their kinship responsibilities and obligations to ensure the collective

5

Chapter One

wellbeing of the group (Durie in Te Whaiti et al, 1997). While the metaphoric whnau model shares common characteristics in terms collective goals and reciprocity of benefit to members of the group. Individuals within the group are able to exercise a high degree of choice regarding their level of commitment to providing support for those seeking it (Durie, 1998; Metge, 1995). Effectively, they are able to make decisions regarding their availability to provide support for others according to their circumstances at the time (Durie, 1998; Metge, 1995). Socio political factors including capitalism, industrialisation and urbanisation have contributed to the formation of contemporary kinship whnau, model also accepting the aspect of choice regarding their responsibility to support extended whnau according to their situation at the time (Durie, 1998; Metge, 1995). While many might perceive the concept of choice to be a strength, only by being available can the whnau provide ongoing support networks for those needing nurturing and/or assistance. A reluctance to provide unconditional commitment and support for the concept of whnau diminishes its potential for supporting and nurturing the wellbeing of the unit as a collective. Even within our four generation case study whnau, this aspect of whanaungatanga and support can be challenging when whnau members do not live in close geographic proximity. T Mtou Whnau The conception and birth of our mokopuna 4 has raised important issues related to childrearing and the roles of each whnau member in the childrearing process. While the roles, rights and responsibilities of the pre-European intergenerational Mori whnau model are clearly defined, 5 those aspects under a modern Mori intergenerational whnau model need to be reviewed, negotiated and interpreted 6 .

Not unlike the pre-European intergenerational Mori whnau model, any modern version of that model would require constant interactions to reach and maintain shared understandings regarding the roles, rights and responsibilities of its members. This research project is conducted with whnau members over four generations. The fourth generation members constitute my mother and her partner, who sadly passed away before the project was completed. My husband and I constitute the third generation members and my daughter and her partner 7 , my son and his wife 8 , my two young adult daughters, and my youngest teenage son are the second generation participants. Our four mokopuna aged 5yrs, 3yrs, 1yr and 7mths respectively constitute the first generation members. The decision to restrict the study to our whnau initially allows us as a whnau to trial the collaborative storying process which is based on the fundamental principle of 'whakawhanaungatanga' 9 .

CHAPTER TWO WHAKAOHO WHNAU
Introduction Since the promotion of the concept of `biculturalism' in Aoteaora/New Zealand in the late 1980s the term `whnau' is one concept that has become familiar and acceptable to those wishing to construct and strengthen support infrastructures for groups under their care and direction. In a review of literature about whnau and childrearing, my intention is to critically analyse values and beliefs underpinning those concepts and practices from social, historical, cultural and political perspectives. The discussion will centre on factors that have influenced the definition and redefinition of the concept of whnau and childrearing in order to gain some insight into how those factors have influenced the perceptions of four generations of one whnau in contemporary Mori society. Whnau, Hap and Iwi and the Metaphoric Nature of the Language Whnau are continually evolving and changing just like our tipuna did, reinforcing the fact that nothing stays static or the same for long. There are some fundamental questions that need to be considered and identified when casually using the term `whnau'. Those who use the term, maybe able to define what it means to them in terms of obligations and responsibilities, or, maybe they use the term, because the `word' itself has become part of our contemporary colloquial language. The general acceptance of the term `whanau' and it's diversity of meaning in modern society, where whnau, family and group structures are continually adapting to keep pace with changing values and beliefs are evidence of evolving definitions (Metge, 1995; Durie in Te Whaiti et al 1997). In fact, the resilience of the concept of `whnau' to adapt to change in terms of structure and the roles of members within the

8

Chapter Two

structure has contributed significantly to its continued relevance and acceptance in contemporary society. The Mori word whnau originates from pre-colonial times meaning as a verb `to give birth' and as a noun, a diffuse unit based on whakapapa (Durie, in Te Whaiti et al 1997; Hemara, 2000; Metge, 1995). Tame Winitana of Tuhoe, and Hone Kamariera, of Te Rarawa argue in Metge (1995) that the original reference to the word `whnau' implied a set of siblings (brothers and sisters) born of the same parents. Buck (1950) supported this claim stating that the term `whnau' represented the smallest social unit in the biological family. He argued that the term `whnau' continued to be recognised for additional whnau. However, as the number of whnau increased with each generation, the term `whnau' became restrictive, so the term `hap' 1 was used to denote the extended family group. According to Buck (1950), the term `hap' was appropriate because it expressed the idea of birth from common ancestors. The idea of blood ties through `whakapapa' supported the idea of collectivism which united groups for the purpose of childrearing, planting, harvesting and collecting kai 2 . As `hap' continued to expand over successive generations, they separated and moved to develop other settlements in neighbouring localities. Consequently, one `hap' soon became a number of `hap' who acknowledged descent from a common ancestor. Their common ancestry was the basis of collective unity to defend settlements or to conduct the development of their communities. The collective unity of hap is described by the term `koiwi'3 . Iwi are the confederations of people related to each other by blood ties (Buck, 1950). Such explanations of the terms, whnau hap and iwi, illustrate the metaphoric nature of Mori language and how Mori words have the potential for more abstract meanings. The abstractions are factors for consideration for those wishing to undertake research into aspects of Mori culture and society. The intricacy of the

characteristics underpinning the term `whanau', 4 tell me that the expression is immeasurable in meaning and application. within their social and cultural experiences. Whnau Whanui and Sociocultural Theory If the lived experiences of individuals within whnau play a major role in developing understanding of the concept in practice, then, we need to consider the social and cultural contexts that contribute to that meaning. Sociocultural theory acknowledges that social and cultural experiences across multiple contexts in society shape people's understanding of the world they live in (Bronfenbrenner, 1986). This perspective is useful in gaining some insight into the meaning behind the historical definitions of the terms whnau, hap and iwi. Bronfenbrenner's (1979; 1986) sociocultural view argues that individuals develop within five environmental systems (micro, meso, exo, macro and chrono). Within an historical context, those levels might represent the individual, the whnau, the hap, the iwi, the confederation of iwi within Aotearoa and the global world which was beginning to have interaction with different iwi. The historical ecological model of whnau is intrinsically linked to whakapapa, which transgressed generations or levels/systems within pre-colonial Mori society. Ecological theory helps us to understand why the characteristics of responsibility and obligation were fundamental to the survival of whnau in pre-colonial times. Bronfenbrenner's (1979; 1986) work expanded on the work of Vygotsky (1987), who promoted the importance of culture in developing cognition. In essence, Vygotsky's (1987) work argued the importance of the interactions that occurred between the people surrounding a child and the child itself within meaningful cultural contexts. Bronfenbrenner (1986) argues that a child cannot be seen in isolation from his/her whnau and for that reason it is important that all those working to support children This analysis is helpful in trying to understand how four generations of the case study perceive whnau and childrearing

to reach their potential must know the child's whnau circumstances. It is argued here that the more involvement a whnau has with the child within formal and informal learning and development, the more likely it is for the child to reach his/her potential. The following diagram (figure 1) portrays Bronfenbrenner's (1986) ecological theory arguing that human beings do not develop in isolation; they develop in a variety of contexts where they are in constant interaction with other people, places and things that influence their development significantly.

Bronfenbrenner's model has been adapted to highlight the Mori concepts that I emphasise within whnau, hap and iwi.

Chapter Two

Within the context of the case study whnau, Bronfenbrenner's (1986) ecological theory may be a useful tool in helping members of the intergenerational whnau to analyse how and why they developed their understandings about whnau and childrearing. Early Research into Whnau Early European visitors to Aotearoa/New Zealand demonstrated interest in Mori ways of life by documenting among other things, their perceptions of the term `whnau'. One such observation and record described `whnau' in the following terms: it was a domestic unit comprising several parent-child families related by descent and marriage, moving between several living sites and engaging in a variety of productive activities under the leadership of a kaumatua (household head). (Metge, 1995:16). Non-Mori continue to demonstrate interest in researching and writing about the Mori social structure in historical and contemporary contexts. In fact, Metge (1995) spent close to four decades recording developments in Mori society and whnau structures in her anthropological and sociological research. While Metge's indepth studies attempted to examine the complexity and diversity of the concept of whnau and hap structures pertaining to different iwi from an objective point of view, the early ethnographers had limited knowledge and recorded their perception of events from a eurocentric, chauvinistic point of view (Smith, 1992; Walker, 1990). This perspective reflected European society which was dominated by male hegemonic practices. Within that society, patriarchy prevailed without question in a world where males dominated public life and public places to the extent where land, assets, women and children were owned by men (Ballara, 1993; Olssen, in Binney, Bassett and Olssen, 1990; Smith, 1992). This set of values and beliefs was reflected throughout the European social structure. Hence, the distorted perception

12

Chapter Two

such as kaumtua, who were heads of households were all male. Those who have any understanding of the Mori language and culture know that `kaumtua' is a non sexist term meaning elder (Williams, 1971), thereby indicating that `whnau' groups could have been led by either male or female. This situation is a difficult one to address because the male oppressor and the oppressed women and children believe in the philosophical underpinning of male supremacy. The challenge for Mori women and men is to revive and reassert tikanga Mori within our own whnau, and to understand that a continued existence where men have power and authority over women and children is a violation of tikanga Mori. Such an existence is initiated instead from an historical eurocentric common law institution which was forced upon Mori. Mori have no affinity to the traditions that reflect that ancient law institution and have every reason to reject them (Mikaere, 1994). Despite Mori having their own set of values, beliefs and world view that permeated through Mori ways of knowing and doing in pre European Mori society, the missionaries and colonists have been very successful in assimilating many Mori into European ways of knowing and doing. The role of the male in society is an example of that assimilation. The dominant and elevated status of the male in European society is visible in many nuclear and intergenerational contemporary Mori whnau. Unfortunately, the elevated status of male is often used as a tool to oppress women and children (Ballara, 1993; Kahukiwa, 1984; Mikaere, 1994). It is helpful to understand how eurocentrism and hegemony infiltrated Mori society so that, intergenerational whnau members in the case study can collaboratively theorise if and how these oppressive elements exist in our whnau. Within the context of this study and its focus on whnau and childrearing, it is important to have an understanding of the role of women in pre-European and contemporary Mori societies because it is impossible to separate women from the roles of birthing and childrearing. As mentioned earlier, whnau, meaning to `give

13

Chapter Two

birth', and whnau meaning a `group of people who share descent from a common ancestor', literally and metaphorically support the pivotal role of the women in Mori society (Durie in Te Whaiti et al, 1997). Whine and Whnau He Uri na Hinetitama Waiwai ana nga karu te tirohanga atu A study of Mori cosmology reveals stories of powerful women who are of paramount significance to Mori socially, culturally, spiritually, politically and economically. Papatnuku is the primal Mother and nurturer, and the term `whnau' commences with her. Papatnuku encompasses the umbilical cord 6 linking the past with the present and the future. Papatnuku is acknowledged as the earth mother. All species on earth, including human beings can be traced back to her through whakapapa. She is the one who nurtures everything and everyone living on the land, so if she is not nurtured by those drawing sustenance from her, she in turn cannot reciprocate sustenance needed by her offspring. From a Mori point of view, the essence of land is in its mauri and its: ...spirituality deeply rooted in the mythology of Papatnuku, the earthmother, and connection with the land as tangata whenua (Walker, 1989:46). The mana of the land has to do with what has occurred with it, who lived there, who died there, what battles occurred there, who was born there, the stories of the people who lived there. These aspects become the history of the land that can never be obliterated (Walker, 1990). While a Pkeha perspective of land may focus on its commodification and economic potential, Mori interest in the land can only be truly understood in Mori terms. Those whnau who reside on their turangawaewae have Having knowledge of the lived experience of what it means to have a relationship with the land that encompasses their marae, urupa and battles grounds. whnau, hap and iwi histories of the land helps them to bond to the land and all that

Chapter Two

comes with it. The land 7 becomes a place where they have a sense and spirit of belonging. Papatnuku represents the primal `whare oranga 8 '. There were only three things for which traditional Mori fought, killed and were prepared to die for. They were land, women and utu (Waru, 1987). A predominant role of women in pre-colonial Mori society appears from analysis to be one of nurturing, beginning with the nurturing role of Papatnuku. The importance of the nurturing role is reflected in the high status awarded to Papatnuku as `earth mother'. The nurturing characteristic has been passed on through whakapapa to generations of women from the beginning of time. If women are no longer awarded high status in their role as nurturers, that situation could reflect that society no longer value nurturing as a fundamental characteristic of wellbeing. This issue is of utmost importance to the intergenerational case study whnau, because if there no real value for and status awarded to the nurturing characertistic passed down from Papatnuku, the holistic wellbeing of future generations is in jeopardy. The high status of women is also depicted in the many stories of Mau (Kahukiwa, 1984; Mikaere, 1994; Yates-Smith, 1998). Mau acquired fire from his kuia Mhuika, and the jawbone from his kuia, Murirangawhenua. With the jawbone he fished up `Te Ika a Mau' 9 , made the patu to subdue `Te Ra' 10 , and it was `Hine-nui-te-po' 11 who eventually overcame Mau when he failed in his quest to attain immortality (Kahukiwa, 1984). The Mau stories and accounts of the search for knowledge portray knowledge as being within the bosom of the female element 12 , suggesting that it would be inconceivable to think that the female element is only important in terms of procreation.

15

Chapter Two

Another insight into the mana awarded Mori women can be gleaned from the waiata 13 , haka 14 , whakatauak 15 , iwi histories, the naming of hap and whare tpuna 16 (King, 1975) and the karanga 17 in ceremony (Szaszy, 1993). The volume of waiata tawhito 18 once committed to memory, demonstrates the significant role women played in the survival of Mori history as these waiata contributed significantly to the accurate and reliable transmission and maintenance of history and knowledge (Ngata, 1949, 1961, 1970; Orbell, 1991). Ng Mteatea Part 1; Part 11; and Part 111 have been recorded by Ngata (1949; 1961; 1970) and are part of that historical knowledge base. The stories and waiata depict the female element as being central to the existence of all aspects of the universe, both tangible and intangible. While there are some recorded instances of abuse towards women, (Grace, 1992), retribution handed out to those who violated the status of women provided evidence of the high esteem in which women were held (Best, 1924; Biggs, 1966; Buck, 1950; Grace, 1992; Jenkins, 1986, 1988; Mikaere, 1994; Stafford, 1996; Waru, 1987). One act of violation against women and the intolerance of it was recorded by Grace (1992). He claimed that Matangikaiawha, a chief of Ngati Awa and Ngati Tuwharetoa descent, was pursued, attacked and eventually killed for ill-treating and nearly killing Hinemihi, a daughter of the great Tuwharetoa chief Waikari, while her father was away fighting. The oral history of the Mori provides numerous examples of the status of women in the Mori world from the creation at the beginning of time down to the present. According to some records (Ballara, 1993; Jenkins, 1986; Mikaere, 1994; YatesSmith, 1998), the first visitors to Aotearoa/New Zealand observed the high status of Mori women in early encounters. The high status awarded to Mori women is also evidenced in the women who signed `Te Tiriti o Waitangi' (Orange, 1989). Some

Chapter Two

chiefs did not sign if their high ranking women were not given the opportunity to sign (Orange, 1989). Their unwillingness to sign reflects the chieftainship of those women. The successive guardianship of land succeeded from women to their descendants is also an example of female chieftainship (Grace, 1992; Jenkins, 1986). Hemara (2000) supported claims that Mori women were awarded mana reporting that the majority of records of early cross-cultural encounters, regarding observations of Mori women, represent Mori women as being accorded the same level of, although sometimes different, rights as Mori men. Ballara (1993) supported this arguing that the pattern of uninterrupted male domination in the Pakeha nineteenth century world was quite dissimilar from the status of women in Mori society, both before and after contact with Europeans. It is important for the intergenerational case study whnau to identify their perspectives of the status of women within whnau and analyse where those philosophical values and beliefs came from. When trying to understand the role of women, it is important to hear the voices of women analysing what they think their role is within the whnau. Jenkins (1986) wrote about the role of Mori women stating that, Mori women, in particular, played a significant role in connecting the past to the present. Jenkins (1986) describes the interaction of a couple and their children with the rest of the whnau in the following terms: In her cultural role the Mori woman was part of a community. The home unit was part of the whole kinga. Grandmothers, aunts and other females and male elders were responsible for rearing the children of the kinga. The natural parents were not the sole caregivers. The routines of the whnau were such that couples could not be isolated to lead independent lifestyles. Their communal living required constant contact and interaction with other members of the tribe in a concerted effort to keep tribal affairs buoyant and operational. (Jenkins, 1986:12). Jenkins (1986) writings about the role of women continue to portray women as nurturers within whnau, hap and iwi. Obviously, within our intergenerational case

17

Chapter Two

study whnau, the role of women and children within whnau needs to be revisited and reconstructed. This is not to assert that the role and status of women within whnau is greater or lesser than the role and status of men, rather to acknowledge the role and its relationship to childrearing and attribute it the status that it deserves. Ng Whnau Mori o ra rau tau ­Intergenerational Living According to literature, three generations of a family living together in a common household sharing responsibility for the collective wellbeing of the whnau represented the `norm' within Mori social structures within the 19th and early 20th centuries (Algie in Binney & Chaplin, 1986; Buck, 1950; Brown in Binney & Chaplin, 1986; Jenkins, 1986; Metge, 1995; Mikaere, 1994; Pere, 1994; Rangihau, 1992; Sunderland in Binney & Chaplin, 1986; Walker, 1990). According to my family records, the communal setting that my mother experienced as a child reflected the intergenerational whnau kinga. Not unlike other Mori settlements in the early 20th century, four generations of whnau lived in the same small community around a Marae with an adjacent church, providing support for the collective wellbeing of the group. Some of the first generation 19 lived with their grandparents for periods for numerous reasons. When the fourth generation 20 needed more support in old age, the third generation willingly took responsibility for the first and fourth generations effectively resulting in a three generation intergenerational whnau sharing the same dwelling. From my own observations, the dwelling that housed the three generations was small in comparison to the average three bedroom home of today's society. The dwelling comprised a kitchen, a dining room, three bedrooms, a lounge, which became a fourth bedroom for the invalid fourth generation and an outside toilet and bath. According to whnau records, there were up to thirteen people living in the dwelling at any one time. This scenario is in conflict with European values of individuality and independence (Durie in Te Whiti et al 1997)

and surely must have required immense good will and ongoing negotiation from all whnau members. According to my Mother and her brothers and sister, they spent very little daylight hours in the dwelling because there was so much to do outdoors. They, the first generation, have fond memories of their childhood and the fourth generation lived into their nineties suggesting that the communal living impacted positively on their well being. Tpuna-mokopuna The intergenerational living experienced by whnau in the 19th and early 20th centuries, provided opportunities for grandparents, great grandparents, and children to develop relationships. According to Pere (1994), the relationships between tpunamokopuna were intrinsically linked. Tpuna can mean ancestors or grandparents and mokopuna can mean grandchild(ren) or descendant(s), so that the two terms are linked together as one unit and are a part of each other. The tpuna, through `Te Iho Mtua', link up the mokopuna with the past, and the mokopuna link up the tpuna with the present and the future. They both come from the same spring of life. Some aspects of the bond between tpuna and mokopuna survived colonisation and were still evident in the way the tpuna acknowledged the birth of their grandchildren. It was not uncommon in Mori society for one of the grandchildren of the tuakana 21 to be taken in by the grandparents' generation as early as possible after birth and/or weaning (Brown in Binney & Chaplin, 1986). The chosen grandchild was seen as an important repository of knowledge and information that the older third generation wished to pass on (Brown, in Binney & Chaplin, 1986; Buck, 1950; Stirling in Salmond, 1980; Pere, 1994).

Tuakana in this context refers to the most senior member of the whnau.

Narrative about Tipuna/Mokopuna Relationships Stirling's biography told by Salmond (1980) relays this practice in detail giving an insight into the manner in which he was born and raised by his grandparents. He was born on the 30th March 1899 in the Kaikoura block, a place near Raukokore (Salmond, 1980). Eruera's stories are steeped in tradition and relate to the transmission of historical knowledge trusted to his genealogical line. According to Eruera, he was chosen by the old people Hiria Te Rangihaeata and her husband Pere Te Kaongahau as a repository of this knowledge when he was two or three years old because of signs and rituals identified before and after his birth (Salmond, 1980). Pere Te Kaongahau, Hiria's husband, was the last of the old men who had been trained at the Whare Wananga of Kirieke and it was he who taught Eruera to listen to and talk to the birds, to take just enough kai (food) from the environment to sustain them (Salmond, 1980). Eruera recalled his hair being pulled to jog his memory relating owners to specific blocks of land, indicating that the expectation of the old people was he would recall and recite information to precision regardless of his young age (Salmond, 1976, 1980). Other writers have recorded that any transmission of historical knowledge only occurred under certain protocol. Accordingly `accuracy' and `correctness' were highly valued and teachings were undertaken under the strictest of conditions, sanctioned by tapu to ensure that tribal histories were not open to interpretation by the learner. During such teachings all foodstuffs were removed and lessons were carried out in a particular place that was tapu and void of food and common things (Best, 1959, Buck, 1950; Jones, Marshall, Matthews, Smith & Smith, 1990; King, 1983;; Salmond, 1976; Salmond, 1980; Walker, 1990). recalled: As I grew a bit older the old man started to teach me history; now and again and little by little he'd try to teach me, and then he'd go on to talk to me about genealogy. He told me about the mana on the land, how each ancestor came to own the land and how it was passed on in history right down to now. Stirling (in Salmond, 1980:91)

20

Chapter Two

Stirling's (1980) account of how he learned about the history of the land from his koroua gives an insight into the commitment, responsibility and obligation of the koroua to pass on information to his mokopuna through oral transmission. If the mokopuna learned the whakapapa that substantiated the stories, he would (for his life time) be able to recite whnau links to the land. The narrative of Stirling (1980) also speaks of the tolerance and patience required from both the koroua and the mokopuna to undertake such a task. He taught me about all the big blocks around Raukokore ­ Tawaroa block, Matangareka block, Pohueroro block, Whangaparaoa block, Maraehako, Kapongaroa, and the boundaries around each one, then he showed me the places where the ancestors collected food, cultivated the ground and where they built their fortified pa. The main blocks were divided amongst different hapu through different ancestors, but it all came back to the one ancestress, Hine Mahuru. The teaching and learning described here can be identified as emergent. Eruera was taken to different blocks and cultivations and the pa and told stories about what happened there, so it was more likely that he would retain the information. Whnau, hap and iwi stories recording events in history are wonderful rich literacy resources. Stories can be told and retold through storying, waiata, pictures, text, drama and the creative arts. He taught me the days of the month, the good days for planting and the bad days, the good days for fishing and the days to go out and catch eels, because the old people had a proper day for every kind of work in their calendar, following the stars and the moon. It is reasonable to think that the tikanga described here reflects how Mori once lived and ordered their lives. There are pockets of people within Mori society who are able to read the monthly calendar according to tikanga Mori indicating that the oral transmission of knowledge and tikanga Mori related to the tides and phases of the moon continues to be relevant to contemporary Mori society.

21

Chapter Two

Eruera, and others born in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, were identified from a particular genealogical line and raised from infancy to usually seven years old by their grandparents or great grandparents. They represent the end of an era where what is now known as `esoteric' historical Mori knowledge was taught by oral transmission to ensure retention and accuracy. Rote Learning as Pedagogy for Learning and Teaching The protocols and pedagogy for the transmission of `esoteric' knowledge has some links to the protocol and pedagogy used in the `Whare Wnanga' of old (Buck, 1950; King, 1983; Salmond, 1976; Salmond, 1980; Walker, 1990). Obviously oral transmission and the role of memory was extremely important. (King (Ed.), 1975; Nepe, 1991, Ngata, 1990). Ngata (1990) analysed the move away from depending on memory in the following way: Lacking a knowledge of writing they depended on memorising to record words and lines, then stanzas, as these were forged. The ear was handmade to the memory, absolutely indispensable...As the taking of notes increases under our education system, so the cultivation of memory decreases (p. ix). Western theory has criticised the role of rote learning arguing that it is in conflict with socio-cultural theory that requires interaction in meaningful cultural contexts (Vygotsky, 1987; Rogoff, 1993). It is interesting to note that different Iwi groups who have established wnanga 22 to learn the histories of their tipuna are using rote learning as preferred methodology. From my observation, the cultivation of memory in wnanga begins with rote learning. As learners become confident in recalling the information, they are then encouraged to link what they have put to memory with their understandings of prakau 23 and explain implications for contemporary Mori society. At this stage, there is an exchange of dialogue between teacher and learner where the teacher scaffolds with prompting. As the learners own experiences are

22

Chapter Two

linked to the whakapapa and stories put to memory, co-construction occurs where the student and the teacher through dialogue develop shared understandings. This aspect of teaching and learning has relevance for our intergenerational case study whnau because most have used rote learning methodology to learn both traditional and comtemporary waiata, karakia and stories. While both traditional and contemporary Mori social functioning recognise the role of kaumatua in protocol (Salmond, 1983), and as repositories of knowledge (Salmond, 1980), the pedagogy of transmission is more relaxed in contemporary Mori society. The practice of identifying mokopuna to live with kaumtua 24 also continues today. However, the protocols around that situation have been relaxed. For example, Kiri Turei (a Kia from Whakatohea) stated that she analyses the needs of her mokopuna and makes decisions regarding which of her mokopuna she will invest concerted amounts of time and energy in on the basis of need at the time. The Kuia's perspective reflects the qualities of responsibility and obligation towards assisting in providing for the wellbeing of her mokopuna which underpin the concept of whnau and whnaungatanga (Durie, 1999; Szaszy 25 , 1993). Pere's (1994) narratives about her whnau and childrearing argued that roles within the whnau were not gender specific. According to Pere (1994), Mori society, regardless of gender, was trained to know their environment and they were expected to utilise its resources. To this end, men and women performed many of the same tasks, from delivering and caring for babies, to fencing, ploughing and digging roads. Pere (1994) argues that there were no distinct formal boundaries for men's and women's work habits.

23

Chapter Two

Stirling's (1980) narratives about his life growing up with his grandparents, learning through hands on experience and oral transmission of knowledge provides contemporary intergenerational whnau with some understanding of what whnau and childrearing in intergenerational contexts looked like in the late eighteen and early nineteen hundreds. Ako According to Pere (1994), Mori learning rested on the principle that every person is a learner from the time they are conceived, until the time they die. Pere (1994) reported that Ngati Hika had a flexible, but thorough system of transmitting cultural practices and economic lore of the tribe to the young. According to her, the third and oldest generation taught their grandchildren history, mythology, tribal and local legends, tribal sayings, waiata, genealogy, karakia 26 , various crafts, hand games and other leisurely pursuits. The second or parents' generation taught the children practical skills such as harvesting, conservation and gathering of natural resources. The planting, harvesting and storing of crops and the need to know and respect land was all part of the children's learning. If Pere (1994) was reflecting on her own childhood experiences, her reflections probably represent the late 1920's to early 1930's. It is reasonable to suggest that people living in that era would have been exposed to and influenced by colonialism and imperialism. Pere (1994) reflected that not unlike preEuropean times, every member of the social structure that she was raised in contributed to its survival. Pere (1994) argued that their (Ngti Hika) lifestyle was built on whanaungatanga drawn from the importance of the people, particularly within whnau, hap and iwi. Pere (1994) explained whanaungatanga in the following way: ....whanaungatanga deals with the practices that bond and strengthen the kinship ties of a whnau. The commitment of `aroha' is vital to whanaungatanga and the survival of what the group sees as important. Loyalty, obligation, commitment, an inbuilt support system made the whnau a strong stable unit, within the hap, and consequently the tribe (p.26).

Chapter Two

Pere's (1994) supported Edwards (1990) views related to collectivism in terms of the whnau way of life and survival stating that her early years growing up with her grandparents involved all extended whnau members participating in tasks such as, planting, tending and harvesting gardens, gathering and preserving kai moana, and gathering firewood. Other narratives from Mori living in those times support the fact that Mori whnau, including third and fourth generation members were hardworking people, who all worked to contribute to the collective sustenance and wellbeing of the whnau (Edwards, 1990; Te Puea Herangi in King, 1983; Pere, 1994; Stirling, in Salmond, 1976; Stirling, in Salmond, 1980). Within that context it is conceivable to accept that gender neutral tasks undertaken by nineteenth and twentieth century Mori society ensured their continued existence which was still predominantly focussed on communal survival. Pere's (1994) whnau narratives explaining her years growing up within the structure of her Ngti Hika whnau are useful because her stories provide insight into how her whnau and hap reconstructed the concept of whnau as a result of colonisation. Pere's (1997) view on the child within the universe portrays how a child develops based on his or her lived experiences and understandings. In order to try and understand why indidivudals within a whnau perceive individual and shared roles of members of the whnau the way they do, it is important to theorise their lived experiences to explore what influences impacted on those perspectives. If nurturing of the physical and spiritual is essential in promoting holistic wellbeing, whose responsibility was this within the intergenerational whnau if there were no gender specific roles and traditionally those responsibilities were embedded in the role of the women.

25

Chapter Two

The following diagram developed by Pere (1997:5) depicts her understanding of: a Mori educational framework where instutions do not stand in isolation, but actually merge into each other Figure 11

Pere's (1997) model is extremely complex suggesting that all aspects identified are continually interacting with each other influencing development and understanding. The model is a Mori education model, however it expands on Pere's (1997) `te wheke' theory of development which identifies some of the aspects identified in the education model metaphorically linked to tentacles of `te wheke' (octopus). Explanations given by Pere (1997) for some of the terms named in her Mori education framework reflect philosophical aspirations rather than what is reality for most people. For example, Pere (1997) defines `aroha' as: unconditional love that is derived from the presence and the breath of the Godhead (p.6). Pere argues that aroha should not be talked about because it is only meaningful in practice. Pere provides an example of `aroha' in practice in the following way. An

26

Chapter Two

individual, who saved enough money to buy a new car, would give it over without question to another whnau member who desperately needed finance because of illness, death or the threat of losing an ancestral home. In my view, Pere's (1997) example of `aroha' in practice is quite unrealistic in comtemporary Mori society. While this practice may occur, it could not be perceived as common. There is now more emphasis on individuals within whnau and clusters of whnau to take financial responsibility for themselves. If Pere's (1994; 1997) view of `aroha' is required as a fundamental principle of `whanaungatanga' in order to keep whnau, hap and iwi infrastructures strong, there is a danger that the whole concept of `whnau' is at risk in contemporary Mori society. In reference to Pere's (1997) Mori education model, the abstract theories or ideas depicted do provide the reader with an understanding of the complexity and diversity of concrete and abstract phenomena that influence development and understanding through lived experiences with those phenomena. Mori Human Development Learning Theory Tangaere in Te Whaiti et al 1997, also wrote about learning and development as being inseparable from the influences of tikanga Mori and the Mori context. In her writing, she takes a Mori design, `the poutama' or stairway to the twelve heavens to explain how development occurs "along and up the steps of the poutama" (p.46). She includes in her design the tuakana/teina method of teaching, which she says is reflected in the `poutama'model of learning and development. In the `poutama' model, Tangaere in Te Whaiti et al, 1997 argues that it is the tuakana's responsibility to support and assist the teina in their learning and development. Within this context, the tuakana is not necessarily an elder, rather the tuakana is linked to a more knowledgeable or expert whnau member providing graduated assistance to the teina 27 . The graduated assistance referred to is paralled to Russian theorist, Lev Vygotsky's (1978) theory of `scaffolding' and the `zone of proximal development'.

27

Chapter Two

The zone of proximal development is defined as the context of learning outlining what the child can do alone and what the child is capable of achieving with assistance. Once the child achieves new learning with assistance, the zone of proximal development shifts to another context of learning which requires support. The ideas espoused in Tangaere's (1997) theory of learning and development can be linked very closely to Vygotsky's (1978) ideas. It can be argued that the poutama model (figure iii) developed by Tangaere in Te Whaiti et al 1997, parallels what is accepted in western terms as a theory to explain how learning and development has occurred in Mori contexts for centuries. Figure 111

Tangaere's (1997) view of learning and development using the poutama is relevant for this study because it provides members of the intergenerational case study whnau with an image and an explanation of how learning occurs in Mori contexts. The poutama and its staircase to the twelve heavens make definite links to how Tane procured knowledge for Mori whnau, hapu and iwi. The stories of how Tane procured knowledge have been passed on to generations through stories, waiata and karakia. Tangaere argues that the pouatma model is an ideal representation of the Mori cultural contexts of learning and development.

28

Chapter Two

Te Pharakeke In order to understand a culture, one must understand the language because the language indexes the culture. A more indepth study into the language of Pere's (1994) Ngati Hika whnau would provide insight into who took responsibility for the holistic nurturing of tamariki within the intergenerational whnau. Fishman (1991) argues that language and culture are inseparable. Khanga Reo, Kura Kaupapa Mori and Wnanga Mori are evidence of grass roots initiatives by Mori to address what Fishman (1991) calls `reversal language shift'. Through those initiatives, I see the grass roots enterprises as being engaged in reversal language shift. In their initiatives, Khanga Reo and Kura Kaupapa Mori have adopted the `pharakeke' (flax plant) analogy of whnau (Smith, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998) as a strategy to regenerate the Mori language and culture. The pharakeke 28 , whnau model is an example of how the Mori concepts of whnaugatanga, reciprocity, collaboration have been adopted in modern times (Smith, 1994, 1995). Over the past few decades the metaphoric term `whnau' has been loosely applied to define a diversity of `non-traditional' set of circumstances where Mori with similar interests and shared goals, but with no kinship (direct blood ties), form a cohesive group (Durie, in Te Whaiti et al, 1997; Metge, 1995; Rangihau, 1992). Durie, in Te Whaiti et al, 1997; Metge (1995) and Tahana (1978) argued that Mori have adapted their customary beliefs and usages to develop ways of knowing and doing that can be described as modern Mori. In the wider socio-cultural landscape, `Te Pharakeke'analogy has been adopted by contemporary Mori society to illustrate the fundamental importance of the intergenerational nature of the Mori whnau infrastructure. It likens the child to the central shoot of the harakeke, which is nurtured and protected by two supporting blades symbolizing the parents; outer blades which represent the wider whnau; and

28

Metaphoric.

29

Chapter Two

exterior blades which represent the kaumtua. The survival of the centre shoot 29 is dependant on the protection of the outer blades 30 . If the shoot is removed the plant will die. This metaphor highlights the reciprocity of benefit where the child as the centre shoot is portrayed as being both vulnerable to the influences of the outer blades representing the intergenerational members of the whnau, while also being essential to their survival (Reedy, 1991). It is argued here that if the whnau support infrastructure is strong, all whnau members will experience reciprocal benefits. The `pharakeke' is used as a `whakatauak' 31 and in waiata to illustrate the importance of the child in the Mori world view. The following `Pharakeke' metaphor holds powerful pedagogical significance for Mori educators. Hutia te rito o te harakeke Kei hea te komako e ko K mai ki a ahau He aha te mea nui o te ao nei Mku e k atu He tngata, he tngata, he tngata. Strip away the central shoots from the flax plant Where will the bell bird sing Tell me What is the most valued thing in this world I will say It is people, it is people, it is people. (Te Khanga Reo, 1990). The intergenerational model ensured that there was support from kaumtua 32 and mtua 33 . The analogy of the `pharakeke' (figure 1V) 34 below visually portrays the intergenerational whnau model.

Figure 1V

While traditionally, any Mori initiative would have been a whnau, hap or tribal initiative, `te pharakeke' analogy, I value as a workable model because it is based on shared goals and visions. The characteristics of the pharakeke whnau model and its philosophical underpinnings are integral to an intergenerational case study. It facilitates an exploration of perceptions about whnau, and how important Mori language and culture has been across four generations of the same whnau. Tku reo, tku ohooho! Tku reo, tku mpihi maurea! Tku reo, tku whakakai mrihi! Statistical Survey of Mori Language May (1999) and Krauss (1992) state that approximately half of the world's 6,500 languages are endangered further arguing that the Mori language is included in that category. Krauss (1992:7) states that "some put the figure as high as 90%". Crystal

31

Chapter Two

(2000) has speculated that the reduction to one language; `English', by around 2100 AD, while not likely, would not be beyond the bounds of possibility at the present levels of attrition. Mori language is declining as an everyday language (Benton & Benton, 2001; Bishop & Glynn, 1999). The numbers of native speakers of te reo Mori are diminishing every year and there are fewer Mori language domains outside of educational institutions. According to statistics, approximately 8% of the Mori adult population are highly fluent in the Mori language. A high proportion of that 8% are kaumtua, of whom 750 are lost to the Mori population every year (Te Puni Kkiri, 1998a; Te Puni Kkiri, 1998b) rapidly diminishing opportunities for natural intergenerational language and cultural transmission. Spolsky (1989) supports the claim that the Mori language is endangered arguing that it has been since the 1960s after nearly two centuries of contact with Europeans. He argues that while a movement for Mori language revival and retention, which included a series of grassroots regeneration efforts, namely Khanga Reo, Kura Kaupapa Mori and Wnanga Mori have substantially increased the numbers of Maori who know and use their language, the initiatives have not yet led to the reestablishment of natural intergenerational language transmission. The continued status of the Mori language as a threatened language is an issue for Mori whnau, because any real effort to revive intergenerational language transmission will require whnau commitment. Members of the intergenerational case study whnau will comment on their perspectives of this situation. Language Regeneration and Khanga Reo Khanga Reo represents a shared vision born within the consciousness of Mori to intervene in the very real threat of the Mori language and culture dying out. The `Pharakeke' metaphoric model very simply, but effectively demonstrated the vision

32

Chapter Two

of Khanga Reo for rebuilding Mori society. supported this stating:

Campbell in Metge (1995:14)

Just as te rito o te harakeke is the source for the flax's new growth, the Whnau is the source for society's growth. The pioneers of the Khanga Reo movement hypothesised that the initiative would relieve some of the sociocultural disruption associated with language loss (Hohepa, Smith, Smith & McNaughton, 1992; Ka'ai, 1990). White (2003:20) supported this and contributed further to the vision stating: It was also considered that the intervention would not only bring about a halt to language and cultural disruption, but would begin to cause a reversal in the pattern of shift, contributing to a socioculturally rejuvenated iwi Mori. Within the contexts of Khanga Reo, Kura Kaupapa Mori and Wnanga, the relationship between te reo Mori and te reo Pkeh is clearly stated in Te Aho Matua (Education Review Office, 2003) as expressions of respect for all languages. Te reo Mori is validated as the child's first language, and the language of teaching. But therein is also the notion of, as an outcome, balanced bilingualism. Clause 2 of Te Aho Matua states: Te eke o te whnau ki te matatautanga o te krero i te reo Mori me te reo Ingarihi--the whnau achieves full competency in Mori and English (as cited in Education Review Office, 2003, p.2). This is a notion expressed in Goal 2 of Durie's (2001) framework for Mori educational advancement, to actively participate as citizens of the world. While Khanga Reo and Kura Kaupapa Mori represent educational insitutions, both initiatives require a commitment from whnau to establish Mori language domains within the home. Both grassroots revitalisation of Mori langauge initiatives build on

33

Chapter Two

the `critical period hypothesis', stating that learners who are exposed to a second language before puberty have the propensity to acquire a native-like proficiency of the language (Birdsong, 1999; Harley, 1986). According to Fishman (1991), the vernacularisation of the language in homes is the key to the re-establishment of natural intergenerational language transmission. Establishing the home as a Mori language domain requires collective commitment from all whnau members. It requires even more commitment from whnau members who have not yet reached a level of fluency in Mori to actively contribute to that goal. The Philosophy of Te Khanga Reo There are four key principles which underpin the philosophy of Khanga Reo. The first principle refers to the Mori language as the cultural tool and language of communication. The second principle relates to the holistic development of the child. The third principle relates to whnau development and management and the fourth principle refers to iwi and Mori development generally. The philosophy of Khanga Reo is outlined in (Te Whariki, 1993:11) as follows. Tuatahi: Tuarua: Tuatoru: Tuawh: Ko te whngai i te reo Mori ki ng mokopuna kia krerohia te reo i ng w katoa, kia kore ai e mate. Ko te whakamana i te mana hua ake o ia mokopuna, ia tamaiti. Ko te pupuri i te mana whakahaere mo te ako i a ttou mokopuna, ki a ttou whnau. Ko te whakapakari i te whnau, i te hap, i te iwi, ki te tawhai i ng mokopuna ­ ko rtou hoki te iwi mo app. The principles espoused in Te Whariki (1993) assume that: (a) the validity and legitimacy of Mori is taken for granted; (b) the survival and revival of Mori language and Mori culture is imperative; and (c) the struggle for autonomy over our

34

Chapter Two

own cultural well being, and over our own lives is vital to Mori survival (Smith, 1992 cited in White, 1995). In essence, the kaupapa of Khanga Reo provided Mori society with a vehicle for change encompassing the wider sociocultural landscape. According to Dame Mira Szaszy, Te Khanga Reo has the potential to become the place where, amongst other things, Mori are socialised into: a new Mori humanism, a humanism based on ancient values but versed in contemporary idiom (Szasy, 1995:134). Any commitment to change which challenges the structures, policies and procedures of the hegemonic state is seen as being an integral part of the process of becoming conscientised and politicised. Khanga Reo as envisaged by the pioneers of the movement, therefore, also has the potential to further future aspirations for `Tino Rangatiratanga 35 '. Te Khanga Reo as explained here has significant ramifications for whnau and approaches to childrearing. Khanga Reo and Kura Kaupapa Mori are educational initiatives born within the consciousness of Mori to realise the philosophical hopes and aspirations for the Mori child. Kia t pakari, tu rangatira ia hei raukura mo tna iwi (Aho Matua, clause 6.12 p.xiv). While Khanga Reo as a Mori response to the negative effects of colonisation imposed upon Mori whnau, hapu and iwi enjoyed rapid growth from its establishment in 1982 to 1994, it has been in a gradual decline since 1995 largely because of changes in government policy which have impacted negatively on resourcing (MOE, 2003). This situation has ramifications for whnau wanting to access Mori medium early years care and education settings.

Chapter Two

Khanga Reo, Quality and Revernacularisation The quality of interactions between adults and children is an issue for whnau who have understanding of how interactions and relationships contribute to children's development. There are very few facilities in this country that provide the quality of care and education that young Mori parents seek as a service. This situation does impact on the accessibility of Mori language domains for our mokopuna. It is my belief that the provision and accessibility of `quality' Mori language settings would motivate parents and whnau to work towards establishing the Mori language as a vernacular in the home. This situation would foster natural intergenerational language transmission (Fishman, 2001). Intergenerational language transmission in the home would contribute towards the goal of full bilingual competency in Mori and in English. The reversal language shift strategy discussed here would promote Mori cultural ways of knowing and doing because in the same way an index of a book provides content themes, key elements and whereabouts, the language indexes its culture (Fishman, 1991 cited in White, 2003). In time, children would be conceived and born into Mori language domains within the home and would impact on the wider whnau and childrearing practices because all those participing in and contributing to a Mori language domain within the home would be speaking Mori as a language for meaningful interaction and therefore indexing culture from that language. Access to quality in Khanga Reo and Mori medium early childhood settings require commitment and sacrifice on behalf of the whnau because they need to be involved on a daily basis to contribute to the quality that we aspire to. Quality in this context refers to rich Mori language domains where children's dispositions for learning include situations where young children learn and create their own knowledge and understandings through the kinds of activities they participate in while interacting with adults who are active listeners and thoughtful speakers in meaningful cultural contexts (Rogoff, 1993). The activities provided for children have implications for

36

Chapter Two

the adult teachers who prepare learning and teaching environments for children. If we want children to be stimulated and motivated to learn, we need to think about how planning for their learning encourages dispositions for learning. The concept of `scaffolding' described here is used in a sociocultural context (Rogoff, 1993) and describes a theoretical construct for supporting children's learning. Vygotsky (1987) described this construct as the child's `zone of proximal development' (ZPD). Vygotsky (1978:86) described the zone of proximal development as: ....the distance between the actual development level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance in collaboration with more capable peers. These contexts and the thoughtful skilled interaction between children and adults within those contexts support Mori language regeneration. While it is acknowledged that `rote learning' as a methodology has a place in Mori pedagogy, the use of repetition and drill alone will result in children being able to use Mori as a second language correctly and automatically, but not naturally (Baker, 1993). There is a danger that the language could become automated, where it may be used predominantly for ceremonial purposes. This approach to language learning would not contribute to the natural intergenerational transmission of language and culture. Te Ira Tangata In pre-European times, conception and birthing reflected a Mori linguistic and cultural context where awarded great ritual and ceremony was awarded among the chiefly rank. It is noted however, that although tapu rituals prevailed in birthing among the chiefly class, conception and the receiving of children occurred with very little fuss among the common class. Te Matorohanga, a noted repository of learning from Wairarapa, recorded in Best (1975) his interpretation of the ceremonies related to rites to cause conception, rites around birthing, koroingo or maioha 36 , tohi 37 and

The ritual and ceremony around the institution of conception and birth

indicate that children born of rank were acknowledged, valued and celebrated by the tribe. According to Best (1975), the term `kunenga' 39 explains conception and the beginning of the acquisition of form. Pre-european Mori believed that the eyes were the first part of the embryo to acquire form. Te Whnauhanga Another important ritual relevant to children who lived in pre-European times related to preparing them for future roles. According to the literature, tohunga recited karakia over children to assist them in meeting the expectations of their iwi. The following is an example of a karakia recited over boys: Ki te mahi kai mau Ki te nati whare mau Ki te tui waka tua mau Ki te ta kupenga mau May you be industrious in cultivating food In building large houses In constructing war canoes In the making of nets Karakia were also recited over girls. The following is an example: Ki te mahi kai mau Ki te keri matitai mau Ki te whatu kahu mau Ki te whatu kaitaka mau May you be industrious in cultivating food In searching for shell-fish In weaving garments In weaving fine cloaks (Firth, in Hemara 2000:11).

Chapter Two

In pre-European Mori society infants continued to be awarded considerable attention after birth. Buck (1950) and others wrote about the attention paid by Mori to the manipulation of the body to enhance a standard of beauty of form through massage. According to Buck (1950) various forms of massage were used including stroking and kneading the muscles with the fingers 40 , pressure against the spine with the feet 41 , and stretching the legs by pulling 42 . There is a saying amongst Mori women: Stretch the legs of your daughter that she may walk with grace across the courtyard before the assembled people (Buck, 1950:355). Hori Ropiha of Waipawa, in Best (1975) stated that infants were subjected to manipulation daily so that the child might develop beautiful form. He also said that when the child reached maturity the final beautifying process of tattooing began. Ropiha in Best (1975) claimed that massage and tattooing were not seen in isolation: Ka whnau mai te tamaiti ka toia e tona whaea kia ataahua ai nga waewae, te Tinana, me te kanohi; a ka pakeke ka taia ki te moko. No reira tenei whakatauki, He tanga ke ta tona matua, he tanga ke ta te kauri When a child was born it was massaged by its mother to render its legs, body, and features shapely; when grown up it was tattooed. Hence this saying, the manipulation of the parent differs from that of the tattooer (Ropiha in Best, 1975:49). Because the case study intergenerational whnau includes a generation of mokopuna that we are all interacting with, the conception and birthing practices that we adopt are likely to be accepted as precedents in the future. For this reason, the whnau should reflect on those practices to develop shared understandings.

Chapter Two

Te Whakatipuranga o Mua Although the games and past-times of children were focussed on building skills to sustain their spiritual, intellectual and physical wellbeing, there is evidence that preEuropean childrearing practices were relatively indulgent in comparison to those of the Pakeha. One of the earliest European observations of childrearing described it in the following way: ...(the women) seemed to be good mothers and showed affection for their offspring, I have often seen them play with their children, caress them, chew the fern root, pick at the stringy parts, and them take it out of their mouth to put it into that of their nurslings. The men were also very fond of and kind to their children (Roth, 1891). This view is supported by Reed (1966) who claimed that Maori children were well treated by adults, to an extent that they might be regarded as being spoilt. According to Reed (1966), Maori children were awarded a great deal of freedom when they were young and were seldom checked or punished. Reed (1966) reported that while on the one hand they were observed as being precocious, on the other hand they possessed a natural courtesy and sophistication and were easily trained. Salmond (1991) also supports this perception stating: Children were suckled until they had teeth and could walk, and their parents carried them around with them or placed them on mats or dogskins on the floor of their houses. Fathers, like mothers, looked after the physical needs of their children and treated them indulgently (Salmond, 1991:422). Papakura (1986) wrote prolifically on Mori life and claimed that pre-European Mori children were never punished: She stated that: The Mori never beat their children, but were always kind to them, and seemed to strengthen the bonds of affection which remains among Mori throughout life (Papakura, 1986:145).

40

Chapter Two

The perceived indulgent childrearing practices, by European standards anyway, encouraged children to assert themselves and the mana of their whnau, hap and iwi. In order to nurture the desired assertive nature, it was important not to break the spirit of the child. Keesing (1928) supported this stating that: The whole family and tribal training ensured that boys and girls were reared to maintain the aggressiveness, independence, and prowess of the ancestral stock (Keesing, 1928:32). Whnau played a major role in educating children in pre-European times. It was common practice for whnau to teach whakapapa, whanaungatanga and tkanga and this was taught in numerous ways. According to Marsden in Hemara (2000), some children of chiefly rank as young as four attended hui and participated asking questions. According to Buck (1950) much of the personal instruction in early years was received from grandparents. The oriori 43 included events in tribal histories, ancient stories, beliefs etc (Best, 1975). In this way, children learnt about their respective roles and status within their community. Ethnographers have reflected that the content of the oriori composed for children are the most interesting of Mori compositions (Best, 1975; Buck, 1950; Hemara, 2000). The oriori could be perceived from a eurocentric point of view as unsuitable, however, the intent was an educational one and it served its purpose well. The teaching of `ring a ring a rosies' to children as a fun song could be aligned to the content of oriori, as it records the history of the plague that killed thousands of people. Many of the pre-European protocols and practices of the Mori were considered barbaric and heathenistic by the first missionary settlers who came to the land of the Maori. Their goal was to convert Maori to Christianity thereby eliminating the institution of tapu and the practices that reinforced tapu (Barrington & Beaglehole,

43

Waiata composed for children.

41

Chapter Two

1974). Whether deliberate or not, the impact of colonisation on the traditional Mori way of life, including the whnau and its role in childrearing has all but destroyed it. The move from indulgent childrearing practices in pre-colonial times to a strict disciplinarian model in contemporary times has relevance for the case study intergenerational whnau because it would be helpful for whnau members to be able to articulate which childrearing practices they prefer, why they prefer them and what values and beliefs underpin their preferred practices. Te Whakatipuranga o Naianei Essentially, the key pedagogical difference between Mori philosophy and western Pkeh philosophy is the concept of `wairua 44 '. While western philosophy values learning and development as occurring within the `hinengaro', Mori believe that the learning and development occurs through `wairua' and that `hinengaro' is only one part of that wairua (Nepe, 1991). Mataira (2000) stated that "when you look at the mauri, tapu, wehi, iho matua, mana, ihi, whatumanawa, hinengaro, auahatanga, ngkau, pmanawa 45 ­ they are all features or characteristics of wairua. According to Mataira (1997): The spirits of human beings derive from the Rangi Thh, the twelve dimensions of enlightment in which spirit entities dwell until physical life is desired and to which spirit entities return after physical death. The inference is that at the moment of conception the physical and spiritual potential of the human being becomes an individual entity endowed with the spirit qualities of mauri, tapu, wehi, mana and ihi; the spirit receptortransmitters of whatumanawa, hinengaro, auaha, ngkau and pmanawa; and the iho matua, which is the umbilical cord of spirit energy which links that single entity through his ancestral lines to the primal energy source which is Io.

Chapter Two

The spirit qualities Mataira (1997) refers to here can be likened to proponents of energy. The strength or weakness of the proponents of energy is determined by the condition of the receptor transmitters where feelings, emotions, intelligence, consciouness and all other non physical characteristics of human personality dwell. Once a child has been conceived, it is the responsibility of the whnau (immediate, extended and metaphoric) to nurture the characteristics of wairua so that the child will develop holistically to his/her potential (Mataira, 2000; Nepe, 1991). This philosophy argues that the nurturing of the physical and spiritual in a caring environment is the greatest guarantee that children will pursue positive roles in life. It also affirms that warm, loving nurture is conducive to happy and lithesome spirits found in caring people. There is recognition and respect for the spiritual and physical absolute uniqueness of each and every person. It is argued that this recognition and respect will encourage individuals to be mindful of not behaving in a way that may cause physical or psychological harm against oneself or others. Lastly the dynamics of the spirit qualities or proponents of energy are dependent upon the spirit being nurtured through toi 46 (Mataira, 1997; 2000; Nepe, 1991). Mataira's (1997) diagram below, (figure v), depicts the characteristics of wairua and the relationship between wairua, physical and holistic wellbeing.

This philosophy is an integral part of what is now known as `Te Aho Matua' or the guiding philosophy for Kura Kaupapa Maori. Many Mori whnau committed to Khanga Reo and Kura Kaupapa Mori have adopted `Te Aho Matua' as a philosophy for whnau and childrearing. Their belief in and commitment to the guiding philosophies of Te Aho Matua is the shared vision that draws whnau, both kinship and metaphoric together. The philosophy of `Te Aho Matua' is relevant to our case study intergenerational whnau because most second generation and both third generation members have been involved with it since its inception in the late 1980s.

44

Chapter Two

Ng Raraunga For other Mori whnau the statistics reveal different situations. Current census statistics confirm that 60% of the Mori population is under 25 yeas of age. Young Mori women between 15 and 19 years of age are three times more likely to be mothers than non-Mori. There is a trend of fewer Mori children living in two parent families. There were 81% two parent families in 1981 and 61% in 1991 (Statistics New Zealand, 1994). The 2001 census reports that 67,068 families out of a possible 949,407 live in extended family variables based on kinship (Statistics New Zealand, 2001). This relates to 14.1% of families within Aotearoa/New Zealand. While these statistics are not definitive, they do indicate that the extended whanau model does exist and that this variable whnau model is preferred by at least 14.1% of families within Aotearoa/NZ. The literature suggests that factors contributing to an increase in the extended whnau model can be influenced by political agendas. For example, if we have a political agenda of increasing family self-reliance, unemployment and other economic pressures are likely to put pressure on whnau to pool resources (Allen, Waton, Purcell and Wood, 1986). While the census does suggest that there is an increase in the extended whnau model, only more indepth qualitative data will provide insights into what factors have contributed to that increase. According to Kiro in Smith et al (2000), who is the current commissioner of children in Aotearoa/New Zealand, there is an anomaly for many contemporary Mori whnau. She argues that there is a distinct clash between 'reality and rhetoric' in terms of whnau, hap, iwi and the notion of an extended supportive whnau. The reality is that for a number of Mori children the notion of extended supportive whnau is romantic ideology. The literature states that even for those young families who do live within tribal boundaries and have easy access to whnau support, many reject the extended whnau model in favour of western ideologies of independence and individualism (Durie in Te Whaiti et al, 1997).

45

Chapter Two

Te Ara Whakamua A review of literature suggests that monocultural policies continue to directly and indirectly shape the context within which Mori children grow up. However, since 1985, there have been significant demographic and family structural changes for Mori whnau. Mori children currently make up a quarter of all children in the population, which will grow to be a third of all children in the population in the near future (Kiro in Smith, et al, 2000). Statistics NZ In EXMSS Off Campus (2001) anticipate that within the next fifteen years, half the working-age population will be Mori, Pacific Islander or Asian. These statistics are significant for all Aotearoa/New Zealand society, especially if the huge disparities between Mori and European in terms of unemployment, housing, educational underachievement, imprisonment and poor health continue. Children are our whakapapa, and whakapapa is our past, present and our future. As whnau and wider community we have a responsibility to nurture our children so that they are provided with opportunities and are encouraged to reach their potential. Durie (2001) proposed a framework for considering Mori educational advancement at the Hui Taumata Mtauranga held in Taupo in March, 2001. He argued that Mori are at the interface between global and Mori worlds and that there are three main goals that we as Mori have for any future Mori society. They are: 1. To live as Mori 2. To actively participate as citizens of the world 3. To enjoy good health and a high standard of living Goal 1: Kia Marae: To Live as Mori To live as Mori is an indigenous right of every Mori child. According to

Convention 169 of the Internatinal Labour Organisation (Article 1.1) indigenous peoples have the right to retain some of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions (May, 2001). Indigenous peoples also have the right to

46

Chapter Two

regenerate and transmit to future generations their "histories, languages, oral tradition, philosophies, writing systems and literatures" (Articles 14 and 15 of the Draft Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 2003). These goals require a regeneration or revitalisation of the Mori language and culture. Goal 2: Kia Rongo Ng Hau e Wh: To Participate as Citizens of the World The second goal asserts: ...that Mori children will live in a variety of situations and should be able to move from one to the other with relative ease (Durie, 2001:4). In terms of Mori whnau and childrearing practices within our four generation whnau, it has reference to members of the whnau supporting our mokopuna to develop understanding of their world through bilingual, biliterate, bicognitive and bicultural development and supporting their confident and competent transition between those situations. Goal 3: Kia Ora: To Enjoy Good Health and a High Standard of Living This goal is historical, evidenced in `The Declaration of Independence' and `The Treaty of Waitangi' (Orange, 1989). This goal rationalises why Mori agreed to Durie form alliances with non-Mori initially. It reflects recognition of and a willingness to accommodate western technologies believed to be beneficial to Mori. (2001:5) supported this stating: It makes limited sense only to prepare students for a life in international commerce if living as a Mori must be sacrificed. In reference to whnau and childrearing, this goal is about supporting children to develop and be confident in both the Mori world and western world. It is about

47

Chapter Two

nurturing our babies and our children so that they will be able to make choices that will benefit them and their wider whnau (White, 2003). If Durie's (2001) framework was used as a quality assurance tool to develop and measure the outcomes of any future social policy developed for Mori, the current situation which over-represents Mori in negative statistics could change. (Ministerial Advisory Committee, 1986). A factor for consideration in terms of social policy in the future is that the demographic statistics reveal Mori as having a youthful population profile, compared to the non-Mori population which is more middle age. These discrepancies mean there are going to be competing policy pressures between Mori and non-Mori population in the future. Priorities for Mori as a youthful population with a lot of families raising children will be housing, good education and income maintenance, so there is a minimum standard of living for those families. In contrast, issues for the ageing population will focus on health services and superannuation. Effectively, this will mean two competing policy agendas unless youth and ageing societies are prepared to support each other. The intergenerational Mori whnau and the characteristics of reciprocity, rights and responsibilities which underpinned the concept of whnau before colonisation can address the issue of competing policy agendas. It is not in the interest of Mori whnau, hap and iwi to promote one generation wthin the intergenerational whnau model at the expense of another. Policy developed for Mori children and families needs to be approached from a principle of collectivism rather than individualism. Summary This chapter has critically reviewed the literature about whnau and childrearing in an attempt to understand the values and beliefs that have underpinned the practical application of whnau and childrearing from social, historical, cultural and political

48

Chapter Two

perspectives. A critical review of the definition and redefinition of the term `whnau' and its relationship to childrearing was undertaken in an attempt to provide some insight into what factors may have influenced the four generation case study whnau members' individual perspectives of whnau and childrearing. Chapter three will address research methodology. In particular, it will discuss key methodological underpinnings of the inquiry associated to colonisation, politics and policy.

CHAPTER THREE METHODOLOGY
Piki Mai, Kake Mai In this chapter I intend to provide a synopsis of some of the methodological issues I consider to be pertinent to research, specifically Mori research. As a mother and grandmother, a researcher and a participant, my role within the whnau is of significance to the study. Durie (1998 cited in White, 2003:95) argues that research should be about the advancement of people ­ the people whose lives are directly affected by the research. To that extent my research process sets out to promote participation and a sense of self determination, `tino rangatiratanga', where all of the participant whnau members might share in a process of power sharing (Bishop, 1997b). Within that context, I find I am my own case study. Issues of bias surround the research as a consequence, but I find the complications of exploring whakapapa and looking after the future in terms of knowledge of tikanga Mori, te reo Mori, education and whnaungatanga 1 , impossible to deal with, if I am not in the text as a prominent player. The purpose of the study is to explore how the re-construction of the whnau and its approach to childrearing through colonisation of Mori society can be perceived within the experiences of the case study of four generations of one whnau. The focus on dialogic process throughout the study will empower participants of the extended whnau in a Freirean way 2 to conscientize their experiences and become aware of how they have the capacity to critically analyse what they do and why 3 , effectively linking theory and practice. The collaborative storying methodology will identify and capitalise on shared understandings in terms of shared participation in childrearing. Collaborative storying as narrative will provide a forum for identifying what, if any, tensions arise during this process, due to differences in opinion that may

50

Chapter Three

exist, because of diversity in age, background, upbringing and knowledge base. We will have the opportunity as whnau to collectively theorise how we might mediate those tensions. This purpose has formed the research questions. Ng Patapatai o te Rangahau: Research Questions How can the re-construction of the whnau through the colonisation of Mori society be perceived within the experiences of the case study of four generations of one whnau? Within the context of our four generation whnau, what are the understandings regarding the individual, and shared roles of whnau members, in terms of childrearing? What, if any, tensions arise during this process and how do we as a whnau, process those tensions? The case study has the capacity to provide direct benefits to all participating whnau members. The `collaborative storying' approach adopted for this study provides an opportunity for reflexivity, facilitating ongoing analysis and co-construction of meaning or explanation of the lived experiences of the research participants (Bishop, 1997). This study also provides our whnau with an opportunity to explore how we can work collaboratively to provide support, in terms of childrearing, as an investment in our whakapapa for the future. `Collaborative storying' is a research strategy that adopts a kaupapa Mori approach to research. It means, in this instance, that a research agenda located within Mori cultural aspirations, and preferred ways of doing will promote participation and a sense of self determination, `Tino Rangatiratanga', by a process of power sharing (Bishop, 1994). While this case study, exploring the potential of our whnau to collectively nurture our mokopuna, does not purport to represent or be transferable to

51

Chapter Three

all contemporary Mori whnau, it could provide useful insights to other whnau interested in the concept of collaborative childrearing as an investment in the future. My intention is to adopt this methodology to provide opportunities for my whnau to tell their own stories and reflect on their own experiences of whnau and childrearing to understand how those experiences have influenced the relationships they have with our mokopuna. Throughout the interviews, members of the whnau will be encouraged to co-theorise their role in the childrearing process to analyse if, and how their participation in childrearing can contribute to the concept of `reciprocity of benefit' for themselves, the mokopuna and the whnau as a unit. The findings of this study also have the capacity to provide the basis for a larger scale study at a later date. Notwithstanding the multiplicity of social issues that could impact on such a study, the decision to restrict the study to our whnau initially, is a personal decision to gain personal insight and knowledge. By Mori, for Mori Bevan-Brown (1998) stated that research approaches developed by Mori have been named by Mori for Mori. She argued that while Mori researchers have developed numerous approaches focussing on different emphasis and points of reference, all approaches highlight generic characteristics considered fundamental to a Mori epistemological viewpoint. This research project through storying collects what can be termed as Mori knowledge within the context of the case study of a four generation Mori whnau. It can be argued then, that Mori data and Mori analysis together equate Mori knowledge, or at least a perspective of Mori knowledge. The storying approach adopted has required whnau participation and power sharing which validates perspectives of Mori ways of knowing. Mutu (1998) stated that research is about the pursuit of knowledge. She argued that the pursuit of knowledge provides those in control of research, with a key to power and control, not only over their own life, but over the lives of others. Mutu (1998) warned of the dangers of allowing uniformed outsiders to control research undertaken

52

Chapter Three

by Mori for Mori. She used her own experiences in research as examples to demonstrate how uninformed outsiders have abused power in order to attempt to suppress, marginalise and exclude Mori input into research on Mori issues. The approach adopted in this project will provide participants with a voice to theorise their own lived experiences and reflect on how those experiences have influenced their perceptions regarding the roles of the intergenerational whnau. Collaboratively as a whnau, we have control over the research thereby protecting the research from negative or derogatory outsider influences. Iwi and Hap Perspectives Rangihau (1992) very rightly argues that there is no such perspective as a Mori perspective. There are only whnau, hap and iwi perspectives. The dominant role of the government promoting an eurocentric epistemological approach to decision making regarding all aspects of life in Aotearoa/NZ society has contributed to a view of all whnau, hap and iwi being perceived collectively as Mori. Because the collective confederation of tribes within Aotearoa/New Zealand is a minority group in their own country, it has become politically strategic for hap and iwi to collaborate in order to effectively participate in decision making for tangata whenua at a national level. It is important in this project to acknowledge that fact and to encourage participants to identify different whnau, hap and iwi perspectives regarding whnau living and childrearing. Irwin (1992) described a kaupapa Mori research model as research which is culturally safe, relevant and appropriate in the first instance, satisfying the rigour of research in the second instance and undertaken by a Mori researcher in the third instance. Irwin (1992) argued that in order for the research to be culturally safe, it would need to involve the mentorship of a kaumtua. The collaborative storying approach adopted by this research project promotes participant sharing of power and control over the research thereby negating a situation where more power and control is awarded to any particular participant. I would argue that kaupapa Mori approaches to research do not necessarily require the mentorship of kaumtua. In

53

Chapter Three

fact, within the context of this study, such a situation could act as a barrier to participants feeling confident enough to express their own points of view derived from their own lived experiences. Within the context of a Mori view, it is important to acknowledge past, present and future knowledge. While the traditional worldview is important, it is imperative that the study take cognizance of contemporary Mori worldviews and their social and cultural diversities. Smith (1992, 1999) argued that the Mori attitude to research is that it should aim to empower people in their day to day lives. Smith (1992, 1999) and Walker (1979) argued that Mori people who have a commitment to the survival of Mori culture and language need to be conducting the research with Mori using Mori processes. This aspect again highlights the need to be able to articulate what Mori knowledge is and how that knowledge is reflected in Mori preferred ways of knowing and doing. If we accept that traditional and contemporary perspectives of Mori knowledge should be legitimated and validated, the landscape for the development of Mori approaches to research becomes interesting and exciting. While there are aspects of the various and diverse Mori approaches to research that are different and can be argued for or against in particular contexts, there is a consensus that frameworks and guidelines for Mori research prioritise the importance of justifying the relevance and benefits of the research for Mori. Research underpins the critique of traditional and historical knowledge and the ongoing pursuit of new knowledge. As such, research is a key component of university business. Mori need to be at the forefront driving research for Mori, by Mori with Mori to ensure that Mori views of knowledge are valid and legitimate. Any perceived reluctance by Mori to conduct research for Mori, with Mori would provide justification for non-Mori uninformed outsiders to research Mori knowledge from their own views of the world. There is an urgent need for Mori to be conducting research, which puts pressure on Mori academics to engage in research, to disseminate the results in their areas of interest, and have first hand experience of the research process through supervised participation prior to

54

Chapter Three

graduation. Walker (1996) used the metaphor of "publish or die" to illustrate the requirement of academics to undertake research and publish their findings. Mori researchers have been encouraged to consider and develop culturally preferred research frameworks that have the capacity to provide interest for and share benefits with research participants. This study attempts to address these issues. Issues related to reciprocity of benefit for all participants are addressed in this study. At the very least, participants will develop a greater understanding of the issues that have impacted on the way our Mori whanau now choose to live and approach childrearing. Our whnau stories are the basis of this research inquiry. The nature of the inquiry is identified because it facilitates power and control issues in terms of whnau participation using narrative as a culturally preferred methodology (Bishop, 1996). The literature regarding research within minority groups also confirmed that by the late 1980's and early 1990's demands to recognise research methodologies that were relevant and acceptable to particular settings were being heard and beginning to be actioned. A 1993 volume of the American Journal of Community Psychology, dedicated a special issue to culturally-anchored methodologies, and a 1996 volume of the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology contributed an entire section to research processes within minority ethnic groups. Kaupapa Mori Research Cunningham (1998) has noted that while there is not yet consensus on a definition of kaupapa Mori research there are a number of emerging themes in the literature. Most prominent is the theme of `ka piki te ora o te iwi Mori' (research which has positive outcomes for Mori and the notion of challenging the dominance of the Pkeha worldview in research (Bishop, 1996). Underpinning this is the

55

Chapter Three

empowerment of Mori in the research process and the research content. When we consider that Mori have not historically benefited from the process of research, and that kaupapa Mori or emancipatory research approaches are relatively new (late 1980's ­ early 1990s), there is a lot of work to be done to restore Mori confidence in research. Linda Smith reflected on this situation and responded in the following way: One of the challenges for Mori researchers working in this context has been to retrieve some space--first, some space to convince Mori people of the value of research for Mori; second, to convince the various, fragmented but powerful research communities of the need for greater Mori involvement in the research; and third, to develop approaches and ways of carrying out research which take into account, without being limited by, the legacies of previous research, and the parameters of both previous and current approaches. What is now referred to as Kaupapa Mori approaches to research, or simply as Kaupapa Mori research, is an attempt to retrieve that space and to achieve those general aims (Smith, cited in White, 2003:93).

Smith in White (2003) has captured the essence of the situation that Mori researchers are working within. For our whnau and this case study, it means that I have had to invest some time in convincing the whnau of the merit of investigating and recording our experiences and processes related to our attempts to approach childrearing. In terms of the research fraternity, I may need to explore measures to protect my whnau from potential attacks from researchers who do not value and/or understand Mori ways of knowing and doing. The recent attack by Rata (2004) on kaupapa Mori education is a good example of the intolerance of academics who do not value Mori ways of knowing and doing. What is particularly disturbing about Rata's (2004) attack is the arrogance she potrays in assuming a right to measure kaupapa Mori initiatives against eurocentric ways of knowing and doing. In terms of the research approach, the collaborative storying methodology rejects impositional models while embracing emancipatory approaches.

Those involved in indepth analyses of kaupapa Mori concerns in research are in the space where they are defining and redefining what constitutes kaupapa Mori research (Bishop & Glynn, 1999; Cunningham, 1998; Smith, 1997; Smith, 1999). Kaupapa Mori ­ Mori centred Cunningham (1998) identified research standards and controls as the differences between kaupapa Mori research and Mori-centred research. He asserted that in Mori-centred research the standards and control stay with kaupapa Pkeha organisations whereas in kaupapa Mori, the research team reflects Mori personnel and the standards and control stay with Mori organisations. In terms of a Treaty of Waitangi framework, the kaupapa Mori research parameters would be compatible with Article ii sovereignty assertions, and Mori-centred research with Article iii citizenship and equity claims. If we use Cunningham's (1998) definition, it means for this study that the research is Mori centred rather than kaupapa Mori. While, we like to think that the research is driven and controlled by our whnau, the reality is that the standards and control are firmly with the university. The university standards control the research process from proposal through to final submission. They also reserve the right to have a copy in their library, which raises issues regarding ownership. Despite this anomaly, Cunningham's (1998) definition of Mori centred approach to research provides Mori undertaking research within university protocols and parameters the space to work towards achieving the goals that Smith in White (2003) refers to. More importantly, in terms of this study, our whnau are becoming aware of the value of research for Mori, including the value of their participation in the research process.

Ng Tkanga Rangahau o Iwi K Within the wider indigenous framework of culturally appropriate research methodology, qualitative methods which provide for the understanding of phenomena through the participants' cultural viewpoints have been identified as a fundamental characteristic. Qualitative research methods that fit this context have the potential to positively impact on participant contribution throughout the duration of the research process (Hughes, Seidman & Williams, 1993). Qualitative research is defined as being descriptive and indepth, focussing on single case studies rather than statistically generalised findings of large sample groups (Cziko, 1992). As a research methodology, it provides a framework within which participants can express their understandings in their own words (Maykut & Morehouse, 1998; Patton, 1987). Denzin and Lincoln (1994) supported this perspective stating that: "Qualitative researchers stress the socially constructed nature of reality, the intimate relationship between the researchers and what is studied, and the situational constraints that shape inquiry" (p.4). These descriptions of qualitative research fit well with the approach adopted in this study exploring the understandings of the individual and shared roles of our whnau members in terms of childrearing. In terms of identifying any tensions that may arise during this process, including how we as a whnau process those tensions, the qualitative research methodology provides participants with the framework to communicate their perceptions in their own words. Because my study focuses on participant observation, it also reflects an ethnographic model. Ethnographic Approach Atkinson (1994 cited in White, 2003) argues that ethnographic methods in research support the qualitative approach because they rely substantially or partly on `participant observation'. In practical terms ethnography has the following features:

58

Chapter Three

o a strong emphasis on exploring the nature of a particular phenomenon, rather than setting out to test a hypothesis o a tendency to work with unstructured data, that is data that has not been coded at the point of collection o investigation of a small number of cases, perhaps just one, to get to the core of the matter o interpretive analysis of data that involves explicit interpretation of meanings and functions mainly through verbal descriptions and explanations (with any quantitative component taking a subordinate role). Atkinson (1994) argued that all social research is a form of participant observation because one cannot study the social world without being part of it. In terms of this study where whnau members are participants in the research theorising and cotheorising their own lived experiences to develop clear understandings regarding the phenomena of a collaborative approach to childrearing, Atkinson's (1994) clarification of ethnographic fits well. The qualitative nature of my study into intergenerational whnau follows those principles which Cunningham (1998) identified as Mori centred and is ethnographic according to Atkinson (2004) because it sets out to be descriptive and indepth while focussing on a single case study rather than on a large sample. Case Study as Participatory Model Case study as a research method according to Denzin & Lincoln (1994) relies on documenting what happens at the interactional level. The documentation is gathered from interviews, observations and analysis. Excerpts from the actual data are woven in to give participants a voice. In terms of a `participatory model' such a study can be described as a `research journey'. There is acknowledgement of the importance of the researcher as being a knowledgeable insider. Techniques used in such a model could include participant observation, interviews, questionnaires and analysis of documents. For the purpose of this study, the researcher is a research participant and all

59

Chapter Three

participants involved in the study are well known to each other. We are whnau. The techniques used to undertake the study will include participant observations, semistructured interviews and co analysis within the interview forum. The last dimension of the qualitative approach to this study involves the `collaborative storying' methodology. Collaborative Storying A data gathering approach that employs `collaborative stories' as part of its methodology (see Ballard's (1994) `research as stories' approach) is an attempt to facilitate the power and control issues that constitute what Bishop (1994, 1997b) defines as Kaupapa Mori research methodology. Bishop (1994, 1997b) argues that despite the impact of the neo-colonial concept of cultural superiority which led to a western epistemological view of the world, the reality is that there are still cultural preferences among Mori people for narrative. Heshusius (1994) makes links to the narrative methodology when he refers to a mode of participatory consciousness where the researcher establishes a relationship with the research participants that is `open and totally receptive' and moves away from the interests of self. Collaborative storying research methodology requires that one have an established relationship with participants. It is envisaged that the participation of whnau members will facilitate this process. It is acknowledged that for the purpose of this study these relationships may require re-negotiation. This project involves an open-ended questioning technique where the precise nature of the questions which will be asked have not been determined in advance, but instead will depend on the direction in which the interview develops. Potential conflict or compromise of interests between the participants and the researcher are minimised through the following protocols defined in Bishop's (1996) kaupapa Mori research model that relates to power-sharing and self-determination.

60

Chapter Three

The metaphoric construct within which this kaupapa Mori research operates is the whnau. Within the context of this research, whnau can be interpreted in its purest form, as all participants will be either blood relatives or relatives through marriage. In addition, as a whnau we will be coming together for a common purpose and with a commitment to adhere to a common agenda in the pursuit of its aims. The whnau is an important construct for this collaborative methodology, particularly for incorporating ethical procedures and debating issues associated with the research. Because the chosen methodology requires the ongoing willing participation of identified whnau, the researcher cannot proceed without their co-operation and support. I plan to collate the whnau stories, which will evolve from this project to present to the whnau as a reciprocal measure. I am aware of my personal agenda which is premised upon my desire to explore the complexities of my intergenerational whnau, and the inherent dangers involved in intellectualising what is perhaps a simple procedure depending on how it is viewed. It concerns me that embarking on a research of this nature could serve to alienate me from members within our whnau if in the long term future, their story is minimised or trivialised by academics who view research as a process based on scientific evidence only. Despite this ethical concern, I believe that our whnau journey and experiences in attempting to strengthen support infrastructures in childrearing for our mokopuna are valuable stories relating our lived experiences. Ng Tuwatawata: Research Aspects to Consider I acknowledge that according to Cunningham (1998), the collaborative storying methodology in the context of this project does not constitute a kaupapa Mori approach because the research standards and controls are not located with Mori, they are located within Waikato University. There are only three Mori wnanga within Aotearoa/New Zealand. Those undertaking research as a process to attaining high qualification would need to be enrolled with one of the three Mori wnanga in order

61

Chapter Three

for the research standards and controls to remain with Mori. While Cunningham's (1998) definition of kaupapa Mori research reflects Durie's (2001) goal `to live as Mori' and supports May's (2001), argument that indigenous peoples do have the right to retain some of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions, it is problematic because the three Mori wnanga are relatively new instituions and are still in the process of developing programmes and robust infrastructures at postgraduate level. The reality is that the wnanga cannot yet accommodate the numbers of Mori wishing to enrol in postgraduate programmes. Ng Hua: Outcomes Despite the fact that Mori do not have `Tino Rangatiratanga' over the research standards and controls within the context of this study, collaborative storying is identified as a research strategy that institutes a kaupapa Mori approach to research because it argues that the agenda is located within Mori cultural aspirations, preferences and practices. As such kaupapa Mori agendas have the capacity to promote self determination through a process of power sharing (Bishop, 1994). `Collaborative stories' as a research approach therefore, have the capacity to include intricacy of human experiences reflecting on many perspectives of those experiences without promoting any of those perspectives as dominant (Bishop, 1996). The collaborative stories will be developed by a means of sequential, semi-structured, indepth interviews as conversations, conducted in a dialogic, reflexive manner. These interviews will facilitate ongoing collaborative analysis and construction of meaning/explanations about the lived experiences of the research participants (Bishop, 1997). The interviews with participants will be recorded and, in some instances, stimulus, such as photographs and video tapes will be used as prompts. The recorded interviews will be transcribed and then, in collaboration with the interviewee checked to ensure that what is recorded is true and correct. analyse the data. This process will involve at least two interviews with the The interviewee, with the guidance of the interviewer, will then be invited to critically

Chapter Three

interviewee, who may, at any point prior to research completion, withdraw any information they feel is inappropriate. Where possible, interviews will be conducted as group interviews. Problems with `Collaborative Storying' Approach Within the context of this study, maintaining a balance in terms of diversity and intricacy of experiences was difficult to facilitate because not all adults in the project were receptive to listening to, and legitimising other member's perspectives as relevant and as important as their own. It was particularly challenging for the parents of our mokopuna who assumed that because of their position in relation to the mokopuna, their perspectives would be allowed to dominate. The situation required ongoing negotiation. Younger members of the whnau became reluctant to share the intricacy of their perspectives in a collaborative forum because they perceived that those perspectives might be assertively challenged by their tuakana. Problems with Relationships in the Study Many relationships exist within whnau. personal knowledge of whnau, hap and iwi: ...at my immediate whnau generation level I am teina to my older sisters, and tuakana to my younger sister and two younger brothers. This information influences how we interact, in terms of our reciprocal roles and commitments, to one another. By virtue of our standing as either tuakana or teina to each other these roles and commitments are binding and fixed This explanation appears self explanatory. Nepe (1991:28) further defined the roles of tuakana and teina in the following way: Tuakana teina represents one such

relationship. Tuakana Nepe (1991:21) wrote about tuakana teina as it related to her

63

Chapter Three

...the tuakana as the eldest child is classified as the overseer, the convenor, the director of the whnau ...roles and responsibilities are numerous and often onerous...the status of teina is of lesser importance and often means relegation to carrying out the more menial tasks within the whnau...this often places a strain on the relationship, and more so if the teina happens to be more assetive and more intelligent than the tuakana Within any whnau, it is critical to identify the significance of both the tuakana and the teina and their respective roles. Members of our whnau had definite preconceived views regarding how the tuakana/teina relationships impacted on issues related to power and control within the whnau and their participation in the project. Metge (1995) and Tangaere in Te Whaiti et al (1997) argued that the role of the tuakana is to support the teina. Tuakana members in this project assumed that any strong opinions they had regarding their roles and the roles of their teina in terms of childrearing were superior to any views held by teina. This situation was intensified because the teina accepted that they were junior and any opinions they had relating to their childrearing roles were inferior to those of their tuakana. In terms of the Bishop's (1997) collaborative storying kaupapa Mori approach to research, the negotiation of shared power and control over the process became challenging. A way forward was to conduct individual interviews, transcribe those interviews and co-theorise `kanohi ki te kanohi' (researcher and participant). The transcripts were shared with the wider whnau in order to give them time to reflect on the content of the transcripts and consider the concepts of diversity and intricacy. This strategy, not only gave all participants the space and time to consider other perspectives, it also encouraged inclusive participation from both tuakana and teina enabling the project to be shaped by the process. Problems with Hui Whnau hui can be problematic because of the intense debates that ensue. Keeping control of the debate and trying to get consensus or an understanding of each person's

64

Chapter Three

position can be quite overwhelming if a tight rein is not maintained. The diversity and intricacy of whnau experiences meant that understandings regarding the roles of members within our whnau were also diverse. The hui forum provided a platform for challenging conflict resolution. It is acknowledged here that the hui forum is not always successful in determing a resolution where everyone is completely happy. Despite this, the hui forum reflects a whnau framework that is fundamental to Mori ways of knowing and doing. Kaupapa Mori research methodologies typically affirm the hui forum as a process that allows the time, space and tikanga necessary to progress korero and therefore development (Bishop, 1996; 1997b). Kaupapa Mori Framework The most accepted principle underpinning kaupapa Mori approaches to research underpin the concept of benefits to all participants. Convincing participants of the worth of the study and benefits to them was an ongoing challenge. At least two of the seven second generation members of the four generation whnau challenged more than once that specific members of the whnau would benefit from the study more than others. Convincing them that all of their perspectives told through their stories contributed to Mori knowledge in terms of whnau and childrearing was an ongoing issue. In the end I, as the researcher, hold the ultimate power because I have to select the tools of analysis and make the decision about what knowledge I will or will not use. In respect of encouraging and empowering case study participants to contribute their views about whnau and childrearing, my insider influence has been useful. My position as an insider researcher has encouraged ongoing reflection, theorising and cotheorising of whnau stories. Reflection of the storying, theorising and co-therorising process helped members of the whnau to identify how the research had the capacity for advancement and benefit to our whnau now and in the future.

65

Chapter Three

Conscientising Processeses Becoming conscientised through the research process meant for me as research participant that I was continually reflecting on and analysing how I was actively contributing to aspects of life that I was hypothesising were essential to healthy Mori whnau development. The situation meant that I was not able to shut myself off from whnau, hap and iwi obligations to complete a thesis. Rather I needed to be involved in both the academic and the wider sociocultural, sociopolitical world. There was a need to constantly balance whnau and childrearing obligations with work commitments, academic commitments, board of trustees commitments, extended whnau responsibilities attending huritau, tangihanga, kawe mate, responsibilities of commitment to Marae activities and responsibility to support Mori political issues, for example the protest regarding the foreshore and seabed bill. As a participant researcher within a Mori whnau context I was expected to meet social and political commitments in a genuine meaningful way. Bishop & Glynn (1992) referred to this situation as `he kanohi kitea' 4 . Freire (1972) called it praxis and Rogoff (1990) called it `sociocultural'. Measuring accountability in Mori terms is personal. It would be inappropriate to write about contexts from a theoretical rather than a lived point of view, lest one is asked "I whea koe i te tahuritanga o te rau o te ktukutuku? 5 " In the current climate where Mori researchers are working to develop acceptable kaupapa Mori approaches to research, it is important that the people developing the approaches are represented in meaningful life contexts modelling the approaches they write about to legitimate and validate the knowledge. Within the context of this study, these aspects were very relevant. Whnau members were not receptive to others hypothesising perspectives that were not observed in their behaviours.

Chapter Three

Issues Related to Participant/Researcher The methodological approaches employed in this study acknowledge the benefits of the researcher having inside knowledge about the topic being investigated. As stated previously, Atkinson (1994) argued that all social research is a form of what he calls participant observation because one cannot study the social world without being part of it. Denzin & Lincoln (1994) argue the importance of the researcher being a knowledgeable insider. Within the context of this study, I acknowledge that I am a prominent figure. I carry multiple roles as daughter, daughter in law, wife, mother, mother in law and grandmother. I have an indepth knowledge of whnau lived experiences and what influences have impacted on those experiences. I can use that knowledge to assist other whnau members to co-theorise their own experiences to help develop understandings about those experiences. Tiakiwai (2001) used the notions of emic (insider) research and etic (outsider) research to explain the difference between insider and outsider perspectives. Emic research is identified as `insider as belonging'. This perspective argues that the researcher with the insider knowledge has the capacity to explore issues to depths that no outsider could possibly reach because of their lack of knowledge. Etic research is totally dependant on the quality and quantity of the data collected. In terms of social research, there are huge limitations regarding undertaking research where the researcher does not have indepth knowledge. Despite the arguments for and against researcher participation, I acknolwdge that the primary criticism regarding ethnographic approaches to research, is that ethnography considers explanations (theory and/or abstract ideas) as authentic reality, when they are not (Atkinson, 1004). There is also a criticism that there is a capacity for the researcher to gain and maintain power and control over participants in the study. I would argue that the `collaborative storying' research methodology adequately addresses the issues of power and control in terms of initiation, benefits, legitimation, representation and accountability (Bishop, 1997b).

67

Chapter Three

Summary The main aim of this study is to explore how the re-construction of the whnau and its approach to childrearing through colonisation of Mori society can be perceived within the experiences of the case study of four generations of one whnau. This chapter focused on methodological considerations related to my positioning in the research as a kaupapa Mori researcher/participant and the research methods employed to conduct the inquiry. As a kaupapa Mori researcher, the focus has been about promoting participation and shared power and control over the research so that all participants might collectively benefit within the context of kaupapa Mori advancement. Kaupapa Mori advancement within the context of this study can include socio-cultural, socio-political, psychological, socio-economic, linguistic, spiritual and educational aspects. Within this context, kaupapa Mori researchers inquiring into the concept of `whnau' need to have lived understanding of what it means to participate as Mori being responsible and accountable to whnau, hap and iwi. The inquiry is ethnographic in nature and qualitative in form. Chapter three discussed methodological approaches I considered to be relevant to this study. The collaborative storying approach was highlighted as a prefereed cultural methodology because it promoted collaborative participation and sharing of power and control of the research using narrative. Collaborative storying as a methodology encourages participants to theorise their own experiences to develop understandings regarding lived experiences. Discussion in this chapter has also focused on rationalising and justifying the exploration of the phenomenon of whnau and childrearing within a particular cultural context (four generations of one whnau) rather than setting out to test a hypothesis. Excerps taken from actual data through the case study approach to this inquiry encouraged participants to include intricacy of their experiences. Collaborative storying as narrative facilitated a context where many perspectives, including the intricacies of those experiences, were heard without promoting any of the perspectives as dominant (Bishop, 1996). If we accept that we as Mori have the

68

Chapter Three

right to define what being distinctly Mori within an intergenerational whnau means for us in contemporary Mori society, then we must argue for the space and the right to define what that identity is, and how it influences our lives. Chapter four will attempt to portray the diversity and intricacy of our whnau experiences and the conscientising processes that we pursued in an attempt to develop understandings of individual and shared roles related to childrearing. Narrative is used to relay the stories of the research participants.

CHAPTER FOUR WHNAU STORIES AS NARRATIVE
Introduction The intergenerational case study whnau represent diverse socio-cultural

backgrounds. Two of the case study whnau are native speakers of Mori from Te Whnau-a-Apanui and Tuhoe. Those iwi are geographically isolated from the urban areas meaning that they have not been as influenced by urbanisation as other iwi living in more centralised areas. Other whnau members have strong kinship links to Ngti Twharetoa, Ngti Raukawa, Ngti Maniapoto, Ngti Kahungunu, Rangitane and Ngti Hmua. All intergenerational case study whnau members bring with them cultural ways of knowing and doing that are reflective of their own experiences. There is only one member of the intergenerational case study whnau who does not speak Mori. The case study whnau comprises four qualified teachers, and most second generation members have lived experience of Khanga Reo and Kura Kaupapa Mori. The storying as narrative methodology is powerful in maximizing opportunities for all participants to share in the power and control regarding what they want to share about their own lived experiences and how those stories will be retold by me, the researcher. Bishop's (1997) collaborative storying methodology argues that the power and control over research does not rest with the researcher, it is instead shared with participants. The process of learning to share power and control took some practice both with the participants and the researcher/participant. The first interviews comprised a set of semi-structured indepth interviews. It wasn't until the interviews were transcribed that I realised how structured they were and how much I as an interviewer was leading the participant's responses. It took several attempts at interviewing to be able to step back and allow the participants to tell their own stories without me as researching interrupting and taking back the lead. I believe it was not until that time that the power and control in the process was truly shared. Participants became more

70

Chapter Four

interested, not just in their own stories, but also the stories of other participants. All participants read their transcribed interviews to check authenticity. They also agreed to share their interviews with other members of the whnau. This process provided a vehicle for participants to share in the veracity and diversity of each other's experiences. I believe that if we had continued with the shared or collaborative storying as first indicated, participants would not have been disciplined enough to step back and allow each other the time and space to tell their own stories through their own perspectives without interrupting. When whnau members interrupted the stories of an individual, it was usually because they wanted to investigate what was being said from another perspective, usually their own. It is actually the second and third interviews as stories that I employ in this chapter because of the close insights that they were able to reveal. The whnau stories were developed initially from semi-structured interviews as conversations. These conversations were conducted in a dialogic, reflexive manner about the lived experiences of the research participants (Bishop, 1997). The goal was to merge the stories of the research participants to create a mutually constructed story out of our lived experiences. In exploring the understandings of the individual and shared roles of our four generation whnau members, our contemporary context uncovers the tensions we face and how we as a whnau address the principles of collectivism and continue to show respect for one another and deal effectively with our individual rights and responsibilities. The case study is going to unfold and show the intergenerational emphases of what is significant to whnau and childrearing, both in their lived experiences and their approaches to whnau and childrearing in the future.. Stories begin with exercpts from the fourth generation members. For the purpose of identifying generational voices in the relaying of stories, generations will be coded in the following way: Fourth generation members = 4A and 4B Third generation members = 3A and 3B Second generation members = 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E and 2F

71

Chapter Four

Attitudes to Whnau and Childrearing Practices Fourth Generation Perspectives Gathering stories about childhood experiences of the fourth generation members who grew up in rural Mori communities in the 1930's provides other intergenerational members of the whnau with some insight into the transitions they have experienced from that time until now. Fourth generation whnau members are philosophical about what they consider to be important when approaching childrearing, perhaps because of their own lived experiences of childhood and childrearing across four generations. 4A commented on qualities or values that she considers to be important when approaching childrearing in the following way: Caring about each other and being helpful to each other are qualities that I observed when I was growing up. When there is strife with children, other whnau members will step in and help. Aunt Lil and Uncle Dick reared thirteen children, including my six brothers and my sister and I, and they had no children of their own. They brought up Uncle Dick's sister's children because those families were unable to provide for them. They also took care of a baby who was left in a sack at the river by her whnau, and they were continually contacted by the welfare to take in children who needed care and support. The dwelling that accommodated this large whnau only consisted of three bedrooms and there were also third and fourth generation members living there. The experience of whnau and childrearing talked about here reflects a setting where the concept of whnau is all embracing. A4 further comments about her memories of her childhood stating: I was only four years old when Mum died at home. She died in the house opposite the pa. Immediately after her death, aunt Lil and uncle Dick looked after us. I remember aunt Lil washing us all in a corrugated bath tub. Eventually, nanny Wira who was in her 70's moved into our house and looked after us. Maybe that was because there were so many living at the homestead and it only had three bedrooms. I don't recall us ever being disciplined while we were

72

Chapter Four

living at the pa. Aunt Lil and uncle Dick were never known to lay hands on kids. Nanny Wira used to make steam pudding for us, which consisted of flour, water and sultanas. That was our pudding in those days. We used to have it with cream. I don't remember us having to do a lot in terms of chores when we were children, although I suppose we made our beds and washed dishes, but I don't remember. The reflections about whnau and childrearing described here suggest that childhood was enjoyable with little (if any) discipline. While the reflections regarding the pudding that nanny Wira made for them as a treat, indicate that there may have been a shortage of money to buy delicacies, as children, the fourth generation did not recognise the situation as being deficit in any way. While memories of living at the pa with the extended whnau appear to be happy and balanced, that was not always the experience. Nanny Wira sent us off to school as usual. Our stepmother came and got Tangi and I from school, when I was about eleven years old, and told us that we were going to the dentist, but she took us to her home. Our stepmother used to keep me home from school to look after the kids. She took my stockings so that I couldn't go to school. There was little affection in those days with our stepmother. There was love with aunt Lil and uncle Dick and nanny Wira, but not with our stepmother. I was kept home from school a lot and was unable to sit my exams as a result. I walked out to aunt Lil's place (about three miles) and she bought me stockings so that I could go back to school. A child welfare officer came to interview me during that year and we eventually had to go to court. During the court, we were asked whether we wanted to stay with dad or go under the welfare. I said that I wanted to go under the welfare. Tangi (my younger sister), said that she wanted to stay with our dad. It was dad himself, who said we should stay together and that Tangi was better off under the welfare. It was at that time that we became wards of the state. The stories of this generation provide some insight into the qualities of endurance and resilience evidenced in the way they responded to issues that affected them, and in the way they were able to continue to learn and develop despite adversity. Because of issues within the whnau, the remnants of what was once known as the mission schools became a big part of life for 4A.

73

Chapter Four

I shifted from St. Pat's school to St. Bride's in 1947 under the guidance of the welfare. I went from there to St. Joseph's. I was greatly influenced by St. Joseph's where we were taught to look after our own things and be independent. My job was cleaning the chapel, so that maybe where I got my values from about keeping the place clean and organised. The values of cleanliness and being organised have continued to be identified as key points in terms of childrearing, evidenced in the following philosophical statements. The intergenerational whnau have a role in the childrearing process. They can teach the child to be methodical and return play things to their appropriate places. They can encourage the child to be obedient, independent, show appreciation and treat others and their belongings with respect. They can also share in giving the child praise when due. The second fourth generation whnau member spoke about his recollections of his childhood in the following way: What I remember about my growing up on the coast is that it was a hard life. I worked really hard and I learnt the value of a dollar. My mother died when I was young, so I was brought up by the old man Swinton and he made us work. I remember, we were shifting stock one day and I saw a lot of people at the marae and asked if there was a tangi. The old man said that my nanny had died. I remember thinking that if my nanny had died, why wasn't I at the tangi with the other mourners. When I asked the old man Swinton, he replied that I needed to focus on work and not be worried about being at the tangi. The work ethic evident in this narrative dominates life, even the responsibility or obligation of whnau to farewell their own. This fourth generation member of the whnau was a native speaker of Mori and very conversant with tikanga Mori. While he knew his Mori side very well he also stated: I always go back to the words of Sir Apriana Ngata. Pick up and make use of the tools of the Pkeh. That is how you are going to be able to make a living and provide for whnau. We all need to earn and know the value of a dollar. I learnt that early in life. It's all very well learning

74

Chapter Four

to speak Mori, but they also need to be educated in English. They need to have a balance. Those of us who have good jobs have a good command of the English language. That's the language of the world. The issue of language is an important one. 4B grew up in a Mori community, where the Mori language was the language of communication. It is interesting to note that he does not mention tikanga Mori when he refers to language. His own childhood experiences reflect a situation where Mori language and culture were not always interacting with each other. In reference to childrearing practices 4B said: We can assist the parents with practical support, clothing and food if in need. In later years, we can assist them with seeking further education or employment and assist with financial and physical resources for accommodation where necessary. He also made an interesting comment stating: "Children should be seen and not heard". This comment suggests that 4B had empathy, but perhaps not the patience and tolerance for young children. 4B suffered poor health in his later years which impacted on his ability to cope in numerous situations. Third Generation Perspectives This generation uses reflexive dialogue to search for models from their past to explain what their values and beliefs about childrearing look like in practice. In reference to whnau and childrearing 3B commented: Coming from a big family of two brothers and eleven sisters, who apart from two young sisters are all older than me, I have experienced shared childrearing. My elder sisters were the nannies and the aunties all in one. These comments reflect a situation where fourteen children were born into one whnau over a thirty year period. Effectively, 3B grew up with brothers and sisters

75

Chapter Four

who were a generation older than he was. 3B recalls experiences with older sisters in the following way: I remember that my older sisters were teaching at the school. I think that Haromi and Rereahu were the teachers at the time and there was lots of homework at home at night. In the evening there was always homework and the piano. The piano, and occasionally the radio, constituted our entertainment. My parents lied about my age so that I could go to school when I was four years old. I went to school with my sisters and spent most of my time with them, because one older brother was at high school and the other one was at boarding school. School was good for me because I had all my sisters looking after me. 3B reflected on his childhood to provide some insights into how their large whnau operated on a daily basis.. I can remember that we always had about three or four under twelve year olds sleeping in each bedroom. After school, we had set chores and just getting to school was a big task. Kai, getting dressed and having to walk at least a mile to the bus was a big routine in the mornings. In the winter, when it was really cold, my Dad would light fires along the main road. We would run between fires to get warm. Dad would light fires all the way to the bus stop. Mum would put hot stones into our gumboots and just before we were ready to leave, we would tip them out and the boots would be warm. We would put them on and run to the first fire to get warm. I can't recall any of us missing school as kids unless we were really sick. At that time, you had to be really sick to miss school. The reflections show that the whnau adopted routines and applied practical and effective strategies to care for children. 3B commented on the high expectations of his parents, especially his father. I always knew my father to be very hard. He was a hard man who really loved his sport, especially rugby. He worked and hunted most of his life. Hunting was his pastime, but it was also a way to provide kai for the whnau. He worked on the roads, so I don't think he earned that much money. Not long after my youngest sister was eleven years, I had to prove myself being a provider of food. Dad gave me a 22 and a box of bullets, and told my sister and I to go up to the Opawa bush and bring

76

Chapter Four

back as many pigeons as we could shoot ­ plucked and ready to be stored. My parents pushed us to achieve and they recognized achievement by putting on a dinner and inviting all the extended whnau. I responded well to the challenge and excelled in education, sports and my application to the work ethic. I could drive a tractor and strop trees at a young age. I knew how to use a chainsaw and could drive a tractor, a car and a truck by the time I was twelve. I was never paid, but money was not the reward. I just enjoyed the work. Looking back now, I think my values have been passed on from my dad in particular, who set high work, education and sporting expectations. If you fell below that mark, you felt you were exiled. My dad judged people by what they were achieving as opposed to what sort of heart they had. If you weren't a worker, you were no bloody good. Providing for whnau, and being the very best you can be were qualities encouraged in 3B's childhood. He speaks of other aspects of learning and development almost as if they are insignificant. My mum was the one who was always there for the other stuff. I guess it was the emotional and practical stuff. You could always talk to her about stuff that was happening that you didn't want the old man to know about, like clothing you needed, and how to get rid of pimples and all that sort of stuff. In terms of how 3B's whnau and childhood experiences have influenced his own approaches to childrearing he states: I now have four mokopuna and it would be fair to say that I have little contact with my mokopuna in Palmerston North. I would be lucky to have seen them a couple of times a year. I have a special bond with the mokopuna I have spent a lot of time with. I am intolerant of laziness, sloppiness and unmotivated individuals and when it's whnau, it's even worse, because they don't know what my mum and dad had to sacrifice for us kids. Putting it into perspective, I guess it's my own fault for not teaching them in a user friendly way about what my parents' values and beliefs were and how we came to be here. It's easier to talk to the mokopuna as opposed to talking to the young adults. To put it in a nutshell, I see my role as safeguarding the values and beliefs that I have been held responsible to. The responsibility for ensuring that our ancestral land is protected for future generations through whakapapa is huge. One of my biggest fears is that my daughters will marry the wrong men and that is a real issue for me. I have always challenged Colleen's commitment to Mori language initiatives, especially khanga

77

Chapter Four

reo and kura kaupapa Mori, because I interpreted that her commitment compromised us as a whnau. Our kids have not been satisfied with the quality of education they received. Colleen has a career in education as a result though, so I suppose you could say that that is the trade off. 3B's comments regarding ancestral land reflect a situation where generations of his whnau have inherited tangata whenua 1 , guardianship rights and responsibilities over the land. 3B is politicized and conscientised about issues relating to the land that has been in their whnau since Tuwharetoa settlement in the Taupo/Turangi area. My experience of whnau and childrearing is somewhat different from 3B's because I grew up in an urban setting. Because of my experiences, my values and beliefs as the other third generation member are more centred on education and healthy, responsive, and reciprocal relationships with people, places and things. While every whnau member should be reflecting on how they contribute either positively or negatively to our intergenerational whnau, I have increased responsibility because I represent a central `mother' figure. I grew up in an urban whnau setting with a Mori mother who was empowered and politicised by her involvement in pan urban marae activities and a Pkeha father who was focused on providing for his whnau. We maintained contact with my mother's kinship whnau in the Wairarapa in weekends and in the holiday periods, however, it was the urban setting that impacted and influenced our lives on a daily basis. My grandparents lived at the pa and spoke Mori within the context of their involvement in the marae as kaumtua. My observations of how Mori whnau operated and my experience within that context made me feel good about being Mori. Being Mori was normal. The urban context however, was quite different. Our whnau was exposed to overt and covert racism, which resulted in me feeling angry towards those who spoke about and treated Mori in derogatory ways. This situation reflects the 1950's and 60's when Mori were struggling being assimilated into Pkeh ways of knowing and doing. The pressure from Pkeh society for Mori to conform to expectations of Pkeh was quite blatantly racist.

Chapter Four

While I was young, I did not notice racism, however as an older child I became aware of racist attitudes towards my mother when she was looking for accommodation for the whnau in between the purchase of new whnau homes or looking for employment. She would always get my dad who was Pkeh to speak to real estate agents because they would say that there were no rental properties if she asked. I also became very aware of racist attitudes towards my younger sister who was quite a bit darker than me. I would try and defend her against racist comments, like hori and blackie. The hostile racist attitudes encouraged my mother to look for support from other pan urban Mori individuals and groups. That's how she became involved with the establishment of the pan urban marae and the Mori women's welfare league. The league 2 brought Mori women together. They organised activities around the caring and nurturing of whnau. There were dress making competitions where we all paraded the garments made by our mum and our aunty. There were preserving and baking competitions and big hui where everyone would be dressed in their finest creations. As children, we benefited because our mum would buy new shoes to match the outfits and we modelled the creations on the catwalk. An aspect I did not enjoy was being marched down the aisle of the catholic church on Sundays, in single file so that the whole congregation ooed and aahed my mother's skill in dressmaking and organisation. I was the eldest female child and the second oldest of the children, so I did not enjoy the uniformity of dress. Although we wore different colours, the designs would be exactly the same. That aspect along with the strict discipline and manners meant for me that there was little, if any room for what I perceived as my own individuality. Having eight children, seven of whom were born in seven consecutive years cannot have been easy for my mother. My father worked very long hours working two jobs to support the whnau, so most of the childrearing and whnau life responsibility was undertaken by my mother. She approached life and childrearing in a methodical way. As far back as I can remember, we had chores and our household ran on routines. We had rosters for everything from setting the table, karakia for kai, washing dishes, making beds, cleaning the silverware, polishing furniture, hanging out washing (even though we had to stand on a chair to reach the clothes line), bathing, polishing school shoes and in fact every aspect of life within the home.

Mori Women's Welfare League is a national group of Mori women that was formed after the 2nd World War in response to the growing `urban shift'. Many Mori families were in desperate need of food and shelter and frequently there was no father figure in the urban household.

79

Chapter Four

The adherence to routines and the methodological way those routines were approached reflects the influence of the mission schools on my mother's life. catholic influence was also reflected in other aspects of our life. We attended the catholic children's camps at the `Ng Tau e Waru' Marae in Te Ore Ore, Wairarapa in the school holidays. We frequented the little Catholic Church in Te Ore Ore on Sundays, when we weren't in attendance at the Catholic Church in Upper Hutt where we lived. We attended the catholic primary school in Upper Hutt and the catholic secondary schools in Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt. Two of my sisters attended St. Joseph's Mori Girls School in Greenmeadows, Napier. Priests frequented our homes and we participated fully with the catholic community. The race issue and the methodoligcal approach to living is identified as an issue. I struggled to come to terms with my Mori heritage and my desire to be my own person. I was not informed enough about issues to be politicised, yet I knew that the racist attitudes I experienced were unjust. I felt anger listening to people talk about Mori in a derogatory manner and was often frustrated that there seemed to be no focus on looking for positive Mori experiences. The murmurings of discontent were sown. When I married and moved with my husband and my son to live at my husband's turangawaewae in Twharetoa, I became involved with khanga reo initially, then kura kaupapa Mori and finally, wnanga Mori. These experiences conscientized and politicised me to take an active role in reclaiming Mori ways of knowing and doing. During that time, I became committed to education and sought formal academic qualifications for myself. My adult life commitment to establishing Mori language domains for my children and my whnau taught me that language rights are a political issue and not a linguistic one. The

80

Chapter Four

The commitment that was required to contribute to the development of Mori education options for my children and my mokopuna through khanga reo, kura kaupapa Mori and wnanga Mori have been both illuminating and disheartening. My personal development during the journey has been significant. What is disheartening is that my children verbalise that they have paid the price for my passion and commitment, effectively eliminating any freedom of choice for them in terms of educational opportunities. While it was difficult establishing Mori language domains for my own children, it seems to be even more difficult developing and maintaining those domains for my mokopuna. For me, thinking about how to nurture `te tuakiri o te tangata' begins within the womb. As a Mori mother and grandmother, I acknowledge, value and celebrate conception and birthing. I have attended the births of three of my mokopuna. While I did not attend the birth of my second mokopuna, I arrived the night after she was born and spent the first couple of days with her. I delivered our fourth mokopuna with the support and guidance of a mid-wife in our whnau home within Tuwharetoa. I have made a commitment to only speak Mori to all my mokopuna. It saddens me to know that my own children who have experienced khanga reo and kura kaupapa Mori refuse to speak Mori to our mokopuna. The sadness reaches greater depths to when my oldest mokopuna who is five and attending a mainstream kura say that she does not understand what I am saying when I interact with her. I have always spoken Mori to this mokopuna and she perceived it as normal until she started school in late August 2004. Her exposure to the widespread use and acceptance of the English language as dominant and superior has had a negative impact on her willingness to continue to accept Mori language as a language for intimate dialogue. My experience with personnel working in senior positions at the school my mokopuna attends has not been positive. Even though 60% of the children at the school are Mori, it is like stepping back in time where cultures collided. Policies and practise reflect ingrained Pkeh values and beliefs. It greatly upsets me that my mokopuna is rejecting Mori language and culturally preferred ways of knowing and doing as inferior because of her experiences at the school. My concern is that the school policies and practices are institutionally racist. A bigger concern for me

81

Chapter Four

is that the personnel at the school are not able to identify that the policies and practices are racist. Where to from here is the big question. The energy required to challenge and shift attitudes and beliefs of people who have enjoyed power and control over others for long periods of time is huge and unrelenting. In order to challenge racist, oppressive policies and practices, the challengers need to be conscientised into political action. The process is a struggle which requires huge amounts of energy and commitment. Personal lives are put on hold during the process. The journey pursuing emancipation from oppressive polices and practie is all consuming. It becomes a lifetime commitment. My concern is that my children may choose an option that frees them from the responsibility and commitment of fighting for a socially just society. The second generation members have witnessed the struggle of their parents in pioneering the development of Mori education initiatives. Their perceptions of how those experiences impacted on them will influence decisions they make about education in the future. Second Generation Perspectives These are the actual parents of children here and now. It's interesting how 2A reaches across generations to reach for meanings. When I was really little, about two years old, my koro used to look after me while my mum and dad worked. He used to take me around in his Morris 1100 car. He would buy me ice-creams and stuff and then he would leave me in the car while he went into a meeting or tangi at the different marae. I remember one day, when I took off with my dog, he was driving all around Hatepe in his car looking for me. He was still looking for me when mum and dad got home from work. I think it was then, that they decided to put me into childcare. My koro complained profusely, but he was a korua and had lots of political stuff to do, so he couldn't really manage looking after me as well. 2A comments on how those close to her attempted to politicize her about ancestral land issues at a young age.

82

Chapter Four

I remember that issues to do with the land (our turangawaewae) were always contentious. My dad and his brothers, and more his sisters, were always arguing about the land. I could never understand why my dad tried to conscientise me about the issue to do with land so early in my life. I loved all my aunties and uncles and I didn't want to hear about their conflict. When I was only two years old, my grandfather took me to a land meeting and gifted shares in the land to me. It was a ceremonial gesture, because he said that it was history repeating itself. He was gifted land by his grandparents at the age of two years, so the event was very historical and significant to him. Perhaps, that's why my dad tried to talk to me about the land when I was young. I thought it was wrong and I was not receptive to listening. The rights and responsibilities for shared guardianship of ancestral land cannot be denied indefinitely. The ancestral land in question is leased out to tenants providing the shareholders with an ongoing financial resource. A percentage of the financial resourcing is invested in education. Shareholders can apply for education Shareholders need to make scholarships to further education on a yearly basis.

themselves available to undertake managerial and administrative tasks related to managing and maintaing the land as a resource. While issues to do with the land are significant in 2A's reflections about her childhood, she also spoke about her perceptions of her whnau experiences in the following way: I was brought up at Hatepe where all my cousins and I grew up together. Hatepe is my turangawaewae, and as children we had freedom within that environment. There were no identified dangers which meant that the environment was our playground. My whnau wasn't just my parents, it was my aunties and uncles and all my cousins, especially aunty Maria and uncle Mark. As children, we stayed over at my aunty's place a lot, and it was never a big deal. We all went to the same country school, so my aunties and uncles could pick me up and drop me off while Mum was at khanga reo. Responsibilities in terms of childrearing were shared. At every house in Hatepe, we had jobs to do, so everyone contributed to communal living. Anywhere we went, we had to contribute by washing and drying dishes and cleaning up if we ate there. We were part of a rural community. When reflecting on how her whnau and childhood experiences influenced her own childrearing practices, she commented.

83

Chapter Four

For my tamariki, I want my partner and my wider whnau to support us in doing the best job we possibly can in terms of childrearing. My partner's Tuhoe whnau speak Mori as their first language and my whnau have spent most of my life learning to speak Mori as a second language. It would be great if my tamariki spoke Mori and could understand and practice Mori cultural ways. While 2A's reflections indicate that she values the Mori language and culture, she does not comment on her contribution to the commitment and responsibility this would require. The non-commital attitude is interesting because it indicates that while she has not made a personal commitment towards initiating Mori language domains, there is still a desire to benefit from them. 2B is a native speaker of Mori and has strong opinions about how language operated within the whnau. What is important about his view is that it is an outsider view to the whnau. He doesn't readily volunteer his opinion within the whnau, so his contribution is precious. He focuses on the centrality of the marae and the traditional demands on the whnau. His storying reflects the extremities in which he grew up. My dad's whnau are from Hahuru Marae at Onepu and they were all strong in te reo Mori. We spent on average, every second weekend with my dad's whnau. The language of communication was Mori. Everyone spoke to us in Mori. We did a lot of mahi kai. It was like in the days, the life there. The people there still provided for their pa, their iwi and their whnau collectively. Eeling, fishing, diving and rugby league were all part of our everyday activities. I spent a lot of time with my elders and cousins there. Mahi kai and providing for whnau is a big part of life for my dad's whnau. We were taught tikanga regarding why we needed particular kai, what it was for, and how it should be gathered and processed. We were also taught the right times to gather kai. The moon was the calendar that the whnau went by. We were taught by elders and parents, especially my dad, both formally and informally. Krero was based around respect for the land, the moana and the kai that the moana and the land provided. We were taught to be resourceful, to not waste kai because it was there to replenish. My dad's whnau went to great lengths to ensure that we all understood how kai sources could be depleted if people took more than they needed. We were taught to take just enough to feed the whnau.

84

Chapter Four

The narrative speaks of a strong sense of responsibility for conserving the natural resources while still providing for whnau. The snapshot into the whnau living at Onepu is almost like stepping back in time where industrialization, commercialism and independence and individuality did not exist. He spoke about non specific gender roles within childrearing stating: Dad's whnau were really loving and caring towards their moko. They never raised voices to tamariki or anyone else. The elders had a lot to do with the babies and the kids. The tamariki and women were always fed first. The men only ate what was left. All adults had a responsibility for all kids on the marae. Tamariki were involved in everything, and there was no distinction between whose children were whose. The boys were taught from a young age the responsibility for providing for whnau, in terms of employment, kai and other mahi. The girls did the same work as boys in terms of mahi maara, mahi kai, however, they weren't expected to work as hard in terms of manual work, eg cutting firewood. The main role of the girls was linked to gathering and preparing kai. Everyone did the work in the kinga. It was not considered just a female responsibility. The hahi at Hahuru was Ringatu and Ratana which underpinned the way everything was approached. 2B spoke about his internal conflict with different whnau values and beliefs. I lived in a suburban setting where my grandparents on my mother's side tried to influence us towards their Mormon beliefs. I always found it difficult, because I preferred the Mori ways and I became very antagonistic towards what I perceived as Pkeh ways. I was angry a lot in my suburban setting, and vented my anger towards even my grandparents for trying to assimilate me into their hahi ways when they knew that I believed in Ringatu and Ratana ways. In that way, I lived two completely different lives. I always preferred the Mori ways. I spoke Mori right up until I started intermediate school when I stopped going back to Kawerau. That was when my father stopped going home. My grandfather on my mother's side was hard and from my perspective, he treated me badly. He was unpleasant to be around. He was just a mean old man and I didn't have a lot of time for him. 2B reflected on his childhood and analysed what he wanted for his children saying:

85

Chapter Four

I want my tamariki to know my Tuhoe side. I want my tamariki to experience what I experienced as a child. I am proud to say that I am from Tuhoe, and I want them to feel the same way. Everything that I saw as good, I want to keep for them to experience and everything that I saw as bad, I want to bury. Education was something that I didn't have value for. I left school at the end of third form and went to work doing a man's job when I was only fourteen years old. I worked in a mill for eighteen months and then I went to work in the bush when I was sixteen. I have been there for ten years. The money is good, but I hate the work. I wish I had other career pathways. As soon as Pinny is stable in her profession, I will look at retraining. 2B's reflections indicate that he has been receptive to embracing values that will promote benefits for his children and his whnau. He is philosophical about eliminating any experiences that he perceives as negative for his own children and reliving what he reflects as being positive. He is also receptive to accepting support with childrearing from those who are genuinely concerned about the welfare of the mokopuna. 2C provides thought provoking comments about what he considers to be important in terms of whnau and childrearing. He has strong Christian beliefs and can see the value in being part of an extended whnau. He identified that: The child benefits from being part of extended whnau because they are exposed to expansive knowledge of whakapapa and various perspectives on tikanga as it is applied in everyday life. 2C has lived away from the case study whnau for some years now and is in the process of moving home. The isolation from whnau and the practical barriers the isolation created in terms of whnau participation in the lives of mokopuna have been identified as reasons for wanting to shift home. 2C commented that he perceived that the extended whnau had in a role in childrearing: ....teaching, reaffirming, reassuring, discipline, providing for taha tinana, taha whnau, taha wairua, taha hinengaro, taha kakahu, taha ice cream and lollies), quality time, giving parents time out, teaching parents, helping parents to establish boundaries. His comments reflect that he acknowledges the benefits of whnau and shared childrearing, while he also alludes to indulgent kai practices that he does not

86

Chapter Four

encourage. When asked how he thought the whnau should address different points of view or any perceived tension arising from differing points of view, he replied: There is likely to be a certain level of confrontation depending on whether or not the parties involved have strong convictions about their values etc. However, parents should conduct themselves with humility and with an attitude of submission to their parents and kaumtua as these issues are worked through. Mostly, it is easier not to discuss such issues and avoid conflict concerning childrearing, however, this may either develop tensions between parties or exclude parties from more meaningful involvement with the child or lead to parties undermining each other's kaupapa when dealing with the child. While 2C doesn't suggest how conflict or tension caused through differing points of view can be addressed, he does make the following comments:

He Waka Eke Noa E hara na ttahi noa iho te kawenga nei, ara te whakatipuranga o te mokopuna. ngari, na te whnau katoa. Otira, mena ka hoe ttahi ki te raki, ka hoe ttahi atu ki te tonga, ka hoe ttahi atu ki tai .... Ka takahurihuri, ka poraru haere,  ka ngaro haere te waka (ara te tamaiti). Na te mea, ma te whakakitenga (watea) ka ora. Perhaps 2C's decision to be closer to his kinship whnau indicates that he is now prepared to address the dynamics required to work towards developing shared understandings in terms of whnau and childrearing. 2D does not yet have any children of her own, but contributes to the childrearing of her nieces. When reflecting on her own childhood, she has brought forward the issues about the significance of the land and the ongoing conflict around it. Dad's whnau fight all the time over the land and who's going to be boss, so we are determined to not let that happen to our generation. The land and making decisions about it shouldn't interfere with whnau and

87

Chapter Four

how they get on. We all lived at each others houses and played together all the time and could swim whenever we wanted to and play tennis whenever we wanted. We stayed with aunty Maria a lot because mum was always at meetings at khanga reo. The Mori language is part of her childrearing reflections which she describes in the following way: .......khanga reo was choice then. The khanga whnau were choice. I still remember Kui Miria as being our teacher in the little office at the khanga reo. Whaea Ivy, whaea Karina, whaea Chrissy, whaea Erana and mum were all our teachers. It's different now because there is not the same commitment to Mori language regeneration. While the kura went through a difficult period, it is awesome now. Since there are more pouako, all the tamariki speak Mori, even in the playground and the whnau don't seem to be causing trouble all the time like they were before. I would love to work in the kura as a pouako. 2D has developed close relationships with her nieces and reflects on those relationships in the following way: I love having Shaniah and Piata and am happy to help out any time I can. Piata enjoys staying with me and so we have had some quality time together. Conflict, or tension arising from differing perspectives does not seem to be an issue with 2D. It used to be a big issue if we had differing views on things, but somehow, that seems to have disappeared. Pinny doesn't mind if we do things differently as long as the babies' health and safety is not compromised. I think that she realizes now that the babies can adapt to people's different ways and still be secure. Shaniah's school work books are a testament to her success and achievement and the support she receives at home. I am so proud of her.

88

Chapter Four

2E is the youngest female member of the generation. Her reflections are poignant. They indicate that if you don't get the relationships right, there are so many issues that can't be addressed. In her childhood 2E reflects unhappy memories. When I was born, my mum was already involved in khanga reo, so we went to khanga every day. I wasn't happy there without my mum, so I cried a lot when I couldn't see her. Those memories still haunt me so I must have been unhappy for whatever reason. I think I was allergic to rules. I had a strong will and used to annoy dad when I cried incessantly. My dad and I didn't really get on when I was little. Perhaps, we both have very strong wills. Anyway, we seemed to be working against each other. I don't remember him being loving towards me. Obviously 2E's relationship with her dad is an issue that continues to impact on her in her young adult life. Despite the relationship with her dad, 2E does reflect on memorable times with whnau. She stated: Whnau to me means my mum's whnau, and my dad's kinship extended whnau. I also consider all those I have close relationships with whnau. I remember going to all the birthdays at our marae in Hatepe. I remember hanging out with all the cousins at night time and having a fire down at the lake. I used to pick flowers and sell them from a makeshift stall outside our house to the Pkeh residents to make spending money. 2E's relationships with her extended whnau are recalled with happy memories. She reflects on her lived experience of Mori education initiatives counteracting the Mori language emphasis. I am undermined for my commitment to the regernation of Mori language. Our pouako at the kura were cool. They were all our aunties and we called them whaea. My days at the kura were enjoyable. When we reached wharekura, there were problems because there were not the resources to ensure that we had a quality education. There weren't teachers for every subject, so we had to access video link which sucked. Most of the time, things seemed terribly disorganized and there seemed

89

Chapter Four

to be a lot of conflict within whnau. I wish there was a bigger subject choice and more `on to it' teachers. 2E commented on her view of education stating: I think that education is important. Without education, you can't get far in life. I think that my nieces should go to an English speaking big school so that they become socialized into the wider world. That way, opportunities will open up for them. I will assist in any I can to help them reach their potential in life. I will also try and help out my whnau whenever they ask. Whnau is the most important thing in the world to me. There is a perception that 2E has been disadvantaged because of her education experiences that focused on the Mori language as the language of instruction and communication to the detriment of the English language. It is a well known fact that those who are bilingual and bicultural are advantaged over those who are monolingual and monocultural. Perhaps it becomes too convenient to blame a lack of motivation to succeed in education on Mori educational initiatives. 2F also has poignant reflections about his experiences in Mori education. He also reflects on his younger years and recognises his own indulgence as a pampered child. I was the youngest of five children and so I was rather pampered as a baby. I attended khanga reo with my mum and my two sisters from the time I was born, so you could say that I was around the kaupapa since my conception. He is the political conscience of society undermining my commitment to Mori education initiatives in a blatant and unrelenting manner. I had some mates at khanga reo who were my age. We spent a lot of time together and we were whnau in every way except blood. I also had lots of cousins at home in Hatepe and we all hung out together. I graduated from khanga reo and went on to kura with my sisters. My experience at the kura has not been that great. I did not have great

90

Chapter Four

teachers in the infant years, so I missed out on the basics in literacy and numeracy and spent years trying to catch up. The teachers I was exposed to in wharekura were not professional. Teachers should have been at kura by half past eight to start kura at nine o clock. If people were not there on time, including teachers, there should have been consequences. Instead, the teachers were the ones who were late. They would often not arrive until 9.30am and think nothing of it. That was the sort of modelling I was exposed to. Their job should have been to model the best behaviour and motivate us to reach our potential in life. The kura should have prepared me for the real world where the English language dominates. 2F does not understand the imperialist vice like grip the English language has on culture. It is all penetrating. Mori education inititiaves fully comprehend the issues and have made a conscious well informed decision to not let the the English language and culture dominate in Mori education initiatives. This conscious decision allows Mori the time and space they need to develop their own cultural perspectives. 2F comments on his perspective of his role in childrearing in the following way: I'm the one who plays with my nieces. I play with Shaniah all the time. I'm better for short periods of time. I really miss my nieces when I don't see them, but I also get hoha quickly. It annoys me when they make such a mess at home and I have to clean it up. I am good at playing the role of uncle who spends short periods of quality time with them. I can do that well. I wish we saw more of Tali and Te Kakara. Because of their parents' commitment to their church community, our relationships are compromised. I actually think they are more committed to their church community than they are to us. Summary The whnau stories reveal aspects about the diversity and intricacy of lived childhood and childrearing experiences that the individual case study intergenerational whnau members perceive as important. What has been emancipatory about the stories as narrative is that each whnau member has been supported in telling their own stories. The experiences of the case study whnau and the reflection and theorising of those

91

Chapter Four

experiences, has encouraged each whnau member to think about and articulate why they have highlighted certain aspects of childrearing as important. Chapter five will discuss and analyse issues about intergnerational relationships of whnau that have been highlighted in the case study whnau stories.

Overview As an overview this chapter will focus on issues which surround various intergenerational values and beliefs about whnau and childrearing. Attitudes to ancestral land are explored as being integral to whnau values and concerns that have to be negotiated by members as rights, roles and responsibilities. Socio cultural theoretical frameworks which are interpreted using the Mori metaphor of `Te Pharakeke', form part of the analytical study of whnau and childrearing and the influence of those approaches on learning and development within the Mori family as perceived by the case study participants. Issues of whnau organisation and discipline will be addressed. The importance and centrality of cultural behaviours are issues of discussion along with the way Mori language is core to Mori identity and the education of the whnau. Nurturing the whnau is the central theme of tikanga ­ the Mori cultural practices that are adopted in their childrearing processes and practices. Introduction After researching into the context of four generations of one whnau, what did I learn from the data I gathered? As an `insider' within the study, I shared in the reconstruction of the whnau where we tried to discuss values, practices and understandings that each thought was important to being part of our whnau. The lens of the study became a shared one and I was able to perceive greater insights into the many perspectives of the lived experiences of whnau members. My own views have changed considerably because of the study and I have been surprised at the diversity and intricacy of the relationships that exist within our whnau. I have been challenged by their thinking and surprised by the depth of emotion that each has expressed as they volunteered their ideas about childrearing and the influence of

whnau on the way children are taught. In this chapter the task is to produce the findings of the study and in doing so, to evaluate those findings through an engagement with the theories and points raised in the literature and the interview data in my research methodology. Intergenerational Whnau Values and Beliefs It is clear that whnau members, in reflecting on their own childhood, have a general acceptance of the notion of the intergenerational whnau model. However, a more indepth analysis of the data did expose contentious issues related to intergenerational values and beliefs about what is important when approaching whnau and childrearing. There were also issues about the status of whnau and anxiety about whnau values, the quality of the care, being supportive, how whnau could be more helpful to each other regardless of blood ties1 . The care ethic was a core value referred to in the data. The reference to `outsiders' 2 within the whnau was an issue and was explained as those members who were not of the direct line of descent but were taken in and accepted as whnau because they needed care and support at the time. Through this discussion it is possible to hear the antithesis to the notion of kinship which is an anthropological definition which explains the rights of common ancestry in societal structures. In such a definition, kinship whnau would exclude anyone who did not have whakapapa links to common ancestors 3 . An anthropological definition is not useful for this case study because it is limiting. The intergenerational case study whnau is better represented by the pharakeke whnau model. The pharakeke whnau model is a metaphoric reference to whnau which defines a

diversity of `non-traditional' set of circumstances where Mori with similar interests and shared goals, but not necessarily whakapapa ties form a cohesive group 4 . Signifying Features of Ancestral Land The ties between childrearing and concerns for ancestral land, is a quantum leap in any research process, but, in my case study, it was an underlying issue for members in my intergenerational whanu study. Some spoke of whanu values as including the care for/of ancestral land and how they worried about protecting the resource base for future generations 5 . Guardianship over ancestral land was an issue and young children were encouraged to begin thinking about their roles in caring for the land. There was a concern expressed about how more ancestral land could be saved from alienation through intermarriage and how spouses should not be able to inherit whanu land. In terms of whanu, hap, iwi and whenua, the significance of whakapapa is exemplified 6 . From a Ngti Twharetoa, Ngti Te Rangiita viewpoint, the significance of the land through whakapapa is a whnau value that has been passed on to case study member 3B, to ensure that what is left of his whnau ancestral land is not alienated through indirect succession 7 . His commitment to and obsession with the land reflects his understanding of the spirituality of the land and his connection with that spirituality as tangata whenua 8 . The influence of the land has created a dichotomy where signifying features transition between divisive and unifying. From the interviews I got a strong sense of how the history of the land unified the descendants with their past ancestors as if they still lived. They carried a heavy

In his 1990 work he gives a history of the land including who lived there, who died there, whose blood was spilled there, who was born and buried. He argues that the histories of the land cannot be obliterated.

burden of guilt that they might not be able to live up to the expectations of the ancestors, yet they shared the same expectations of the future generations to carry on the legacies of the whnau ­ to keep histories alive. Any hint or danger of further alienation and or fragmentation of the land acted as a unifying motivator as it kept the faith with past ancestors and protected the legacy of the future. Part of the childrearing process had to be about teaching children about ancestral obligations and how their identity is linked to the tradition of an ancestral whnau and their duty to protect the land legacy. Guardianship and maintenance of the land as a resource, was therefore of prime concern to the whnau. The land in question provides a significant economic resource to the shareholders 9 . In my opinion, the western perspective of land and its commodification and economic potential intensify the debate. Fear of losing the land through alienation of direct succession and/or government policy is intensified because of the current situation where there is not enough ancestral land to accommodate all descendants. Thousands of shareholders in multiple owned lands are left arguing over who will benefit from the resource. While second generation members in the intergenerational whnau understood the significance of the land 10 , they expressed a desire for change in the power dynamics. They were dissatisfied with the way decisions were made about Mori land matters and fears of alienation of land. They would rather relinquish their responsibility to land in favour of nurturing good relationships with their extended whnau 11 . The irony of the situation is that this situation could eventuate because of second generation anxieties over the volatile relationships between whnau when dealing with issues to do with the land. Waru (1987) argued that in pre colonial times, Mori fought and were prepared to die for land, women and utu. While an element of these values for and belief in land is evident in the third generation of the case study whnau, it is being challenged by second generation members, who hate the fighting over land. This factor has significance for childrearing because second

generation members are the parents of today's children. They will influence the future generation. Te Pharakeke and Socio-cultural Theory Bronfenbrenner's (1986) socio-cultural theory which promoted Vygotsky's (1987) ideas of the importance of the interactions that occur between the people surrounding a child and the child itself is useful here in analysing how children are influenced by the whnau dyanamics around them. I see danger in whnau attempts where one generation tries to teach first generation members their rights and responsibilities in relation to ancestral land, but who are then undermined by another generation dismissing the krero as insignificant. Pitting one generation against another in continual struggle over contentious issues to do with the land will result in all round loss of the assets and the disbanding of the whnau unit. Te Tuakiri o te Tangata Socio cultural theory aligns well with kaupapa Mori understanding of how the transmission of spiritual elements can impact positively or negatively on the spiritual characteristics of human personality 12 because it focuses on how the quality of interactions that occur between people, impact and influence their development. Informants to the study highlighted the nature of interactions between other people, places and things in the past, present and future as significant determinants in the development of positive and/or negative relationships 13 .

Chapter Five

I think that whnau members need to focus more on how they interact with and treat each other. Tangaere in Te Whaiti et al (1997) refers to relationships using tuakana/teina to explain how scaffolding learning occurs within a Mori cultural context where the tuakana supports and assists the teina. If we consider that the fourth, third and second generation members are tuakana and the first generation are teina, the tuakana are modelling for the teina and teaching them how to speak to and treat each other. These humanistic qualities were devalued by one third generation whnau member 15 who relegated them as insignificant when prioritising his values and beliefs about how to approach whnau and childrearing. I think that if we get to a point where the humanistic elements of life are ignored, the capacity of whnau to operate in a functional manner is at risk. Manaakihia te Pharakeke Childrearing and meeting whnau needs were symbiotic elements which were central to the case study. These elements spoke of the care, support and guidance ethic was raised as being critical to whnau ethics 16 . Meeting whnau needs alluded to help with childrearing. Such help required that `other' whnau members ought to instantly help without needing to be asked. The help was a taken-for-granted assumption of care, support and guidance being readily available. Writers like Metge (1995) spend time describing the characteristsics of the Mori whnau and how they socially organise themselves to meet their everyday needs. Mori writers like Smith (1994), and publications from Te Khanga Reo (1990), make statements about the importance of the whnau ethic of `manaakitanga' ­ an element of reciprocity of care and nurturing. Such a notion of `reciprocity of benefit' where all intergenerational whnau members can benefit from a support infrastructure where everyone contributed mutually to meeting the needs of the whnau, was inherent in the data volunteered from the case study participants.

Chapter Five

Pere (1994; 1997), argues that the elements of care, support and guidance, are about `whanaungatanga'. To ensure the elements functioned cohesively she argued that a commitment to `aroha' was vital to the practices of whanaungatanga. According to Pere (1994; 1997), aroha, loyalty, obligation and commitment contributed to a support infrastructure for kinship whnau. While it has already been established that the intergenerational case study whnau goes beyond the anthropological definition of `kinship whnau', the argument is that these qualities of care, support and guidance are still relevant to our understanding of the metaphoric whnau. In line with Pere's (1994, 1997) discussions the arrangements that exist within the Ngti Hika intergenerational whnau reflect a societal organisation where all tasks related to the collective sustenance and wellbeing of the whnau are perceived as being gender neutral. A second generation informant also spoke about his Thoe whnau in the same way. Other mythical 17 , metaphoric 18 and narrative 19 references to whnau highlight the significance of the role of women as nurturers and leaders within whnau. The metaphoric nature of the Mori language 20 signals the importance of the role of women within whnau where it is not unusual to see women in leading roles in terms of whnau and childrearing. The values of nurturing, caring, manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, aroha, wairua and organising whnau are central to the way women operate within the whnau context. Organising the Home around the Disciplining of Whnau In her comments about the influence of regimental structures of catholic boarding schools on her values and beliefs about routine and organising the home and whnau 21 , 4A gave indications of her anxiety that traditional whnau values were being lost in favour of more indulgent childrearing practices. She expressed a fear

based on her observations and knowledge over the last years, that whnau no longer kept the kind of order, routine and control 22 that was necessary to effectively lead and organise whnau in a functional way. While she speaks of `order and control' she is not referring to a Spartan or authoritarian regime of tough discipline. On the contrary, she herself recalls that she does not remember being disciplined as a young child23 . A second generation member spoke about the problem of too much discipline 24 and the negative consequences that might have. Writings of the indulgent childrearing practices of the Mori are sourced to some of the the earliest European observations of whnau and childrearing. The writings record that Mori children were treated with kindness and love 25 . Keesing (1928) in his anthropological research observed that in order to nurture the desired assertive nature of children, it was important not to break the spirit of the child. Barrington and Beaglehole (1974), focus on politeness, manners and a disciplinarian approach to childrearing as a residue of missionary influence based on Victorian nineteenth century values. It is likely that Mori whnau began to adopt this approach to childrearing because of two factors. Firstly, whnau no longer needed to maintain the aggressive, independent fighting spirit to defend their communities, and secondly, the culminating effects of colonislation meant that whnau were expected to take responsibility to ensure that the behaviour of their children [which in Spoonley's (2000) view] conformed to western values and beliefs

Chapter Five

The Influence of Tikanga Mori on Childrearing Practices Mori writers have theorised 26 how Mori cultural contexts can be incorporated into and underpin learning and development for Mori children. All participants made reference to what can be identified as tikanga 27 . One of them ­ 4A ­ had some anxiety about the integration of `tikanga 28 ' into childrearing practices. She felt that the rigour was lacking in the way tikanga was incorporated into modern whanau practices. Some informants recalled how tikanga played a significant role in their own childhood. One informant talked about how difficult it was for her to adhere to any sort of tikanga. On the whole though most informants conceded that tikanga needed to be integrated into Maori childrearing practices. In my opinion the implementation of tikanga Mori cannot be isolated from te reo Mori, which I see as integral to practising a tikanga Mori approach to childrearing. An anthropological understanding of the place of language within culture is that language is the culture bearing unit. Therefore as language indexes the culture, it is impossible to fully comprehend and therefore implement culture/tikanga without the language because the language signifies and carries cultural meanings. For a long time it has been my concern and commitment that we as whnau must make a concerted effort to using the Mori language. I have not been alone in this belief and practice. Many Mori families led by people of my generation were the founders and teachers of Khanga Reo in the 1980s and 90s. We were so passionate in our beliefs of the identifiable links between language and tikanga and were convinced that past schooling practice of teaching only in English cost Mori society three generations of language loss that was identified in the Benton studies of language in the late 1970s.

26

Tangaere in Te Whaiti et al (1997) developed the `poutama' metaphor to explain Mori human development learning theory. Pere (1997) developed an holistic Mori education framework showing how tangible and non tangible phenomena interact with each other to influence learning. Mataira (1997; 2000) is known as the matriarch of kura kaupapa Mori. She has contributed significantly to the guiding philosophy for kura kaupapa Mori called `Te Aho Matua'. Her work focuses on the spiritual aspects of learning and development. 27 See thesis data entries pages 69-88. 28 Custom - applying what is right in a given context.

Chapter Five

Without a real understanding of the purpose and meaning of the practices of tikanga, the adoption of tikanga processes would simply become an exercise in abstract thought, resulting in limited understanding. The thought of a Mori childrearing process as a social structure void of tikanga is frightening to contemplate, but listening to the criticisms of the second generation in the study [which I discuss shortly] and watching them choose mainstream alternatives so that my mokopuna are not being taught te reo me na tikanga as they [my children] were under my guidance and tutelage, is painful for me to accept as an intergenerational participant in our whanau. I riro Mori atu, me hoki Mori mai The issue of Mori language was a prominent point raised by most informants in the study 29 . While there was strong support for the relevance and importance of Mori language, there was no mention of any individual or shared commitment to establish Mori language domains within the home to reverse the shift 30 away from Mori language to English. Third 31 and second generation 32 whnau members challenged my commitment to Mori language initiatives because they perceived that the quality of education provided was compromised by my commitment and passion to develop kaupapa Mori education opportunities to re-establish Mori language and culture through intergenerational language and culture transmission. The reluctance of the second generation intergenerational whnau to make any commitment to re-establishing Mori language domains within the home is of real concern to me because it has huge ramifications for childrearing. As I am a big part of my own case study the future presents a gloomy horizon from the new dawning of hope that the third generation group once held through their dreams and aspirations of

Khanga Reo.

If the second generation whnau members continue with their

reluctance to use the Mori language within the home, the regeneration strategies that consumed my young adult life have not been able to be sustained past one generation. It demonstrates how quickly a language can be regained and how quickly it can become a metaphor of paradise lost. Childrearing and the First Generation In the intergenerational case study, the first generation do not feature as participants ­ instead they are the objects of our intergenerational gaze towards the future. I persist with them in using the Mori language as the medium for communication when interacting with them. I chase the illusive horizon and take my mokopuna with me in the hope that they will realise the goals I have for them to be fluent speakers of Mori. I cannot bear to entertain the possibility that faces me of the predicted demise of the Mori language 33 . Mori Education Initiatives Te manu ka kai i te miro, nna te ngahere Te manu ka kai i te matauranga, nna te ao This whakatauaki refers to the importance of education in the Mori world. Informants to the research identified education as being a dominant feature when reflecting on their own childhood and approaching childrearing in the future 34 . A fourth generation whnau member referred to Apirana Ngata's whakatauaki `e tipu e rea' to highlight the need to pursue western education while holding on to the Mori

May (1999) argues that half of the world's 6,500 languages are endangered and that Mori language is included in that category. Krauss (1992) argues that some put that figure as high as 90%. Crystal (2000) speculated that all societies could be reduced to one language ­ English, by 2100AD. Spolsky (1989) says that while Mori language regeneration strategies have substantially increased the number of people who know how to speak Mori, the initiatives have not yet led to the re-establishment of natural intergenerational language transmission. 34 See thesis data entries pages72, 73, 74, 77, 82, 84, 86 & 87.

cultural values and beliefs 35 . Second generation whnau members criticised their experiences of kaupapa Mori education because they perceived that my generation ­ third generation - who pioneered Mori education initiatives within Twharetoa, did so at the expense of the quality of content and provision of curriculum subjects that were offered within those initiatives. In our zeal we had prioritised a philosophical ideology of by Mori, for Mori, in Mori but could make no guarantees about quality of staffing and resources to support such radical interventions into Maori education. As pioneers we envisaged more support than we actually got. We survived on hope and the goodwill of whnau who joined us. During the years of the renaissance of khanga reo and kura kaupapa Mori, those initiatives gave Mori people hope to be emancipated from the imperialistic grip the colonisers had on education for Mori. Pioneers of the initiatives gladly seized the opportunity to reclaim Mori ways of knowing and doing 36 in the belief that our mission was the flagship of Maori education and that it validated and legitimated Maori teaching and learning. Such was our commitment to the moment, we were in a euphoria of our own making. We were encouraged by the growing numbers of whnau members. As we grew, we went from strength to strength and did not take the time to take stock of our situation or invest resources that would put measures in place to guard us against a rainy day in the movement. The warning coming from the second generation case study members if I am prepared to hear it, is that area of greatest vulnerability in our initiatives were our children themselves. They too were in the struggle, but they were not the power-brokers of the struggle ­ they were the pawns in the process. They were the ones who were moved from pillar to post, whose education was always at stake. They were the ones who frequently were disadvantaged by lethargic government policies that were slow to support alternative schooling for Mori. When staffing was short, or unscheduled hui were called, classes were disrupted. Most reading and writing materials were unsophisticated and sports resources were limited, so many programmes were restrictive. It is little

wonder therefore, that second generation members of the intergenerational whnau study show signs of weariness and have become very tired and battle scarred by the process of alternative schooling. I interpret their reluctance to continue the struggle for the philosophical aspirations of `Te Aho Matua' 37 and the goals highlighted by Durie (2001) 38 towards Mori educational advancement as warning signs that we must heed if we are to retain their confidence, trust and interest in maintaining and promoting the aspirations of the 1980s and 1990s for Mori education alternatives. Should third and fourth generation members fail in these promotions there will be a slide to the abyss for Mori education and knowledge. We must motivate and turn second generation reluctance to active involvement in the struggle otherwise the ramifications for first generation children ­ our mokopuna ­ heralds a grave future where Mori cultural ways of knowing and doing will give way espistemologies and practices. The Pursuit of a Mori Approach to Conducting Research A perspective on research by Maori, for Maori 39 raises the question, `is that enough'? I am an informed `insider' 40 researcher participant within this study about intergenerational relationships and childrearing. In terms of the protocols of Waikato University, the ethics committee approved this research process including the process for obtaining participant consent 41 . It could be argued that the power and control over the research rests with the university and the ethics committee. I argue that the real power and control is with the participants. The `kanohi kitea' 42 methodological practice constituted the real consent. The fact that participants engaged in dialogue about their perspectives of intergenerational whnau and childrearing demonstrates to Western

The guiding philosophy of kura kaupapa Mori. Refer to Durie's (2001) paper presented to the Mori education forum in Taupo. 39 Bevan-Brown, (1998) writes about research approaches developed by Mori. She states that those approaches have been named by Mori, for Mori underpinning characteristics fundamental to a Mori espitemological viewpoint. 40 Mutu (1998) writes about the dangers of allowing uninformed outsiders to control research undertaken by Mori for Mori. 41 Attached as appendix. 42 Refers to kanohi ki te kanohi (face to face) methodological practice.

their willing participation 43 . There is an element of trust here that I would present their stories in a sensitive manner so that they benefit 44 from the participation. This context is about whanaungatanga and reciprocity of benefit that Bishop (1996) talks about in his storying as narrative methodological practice. My research project is written for a Mori audience and is unlikely to benefit or be of interest to non-Mori researchers. The research project has been about convincing the intergenerational whnau of the value of the project for them and implementing approaches to research that reflect Mori preferred ways of knowing and doing while maximising benefits to participants.

Bishop (1996); Bevan-Brown (1998); Cunningham (1998); Smith (1992;1999); Walker (1996); There is a general acceptance that kaupapa Mori approaches to research prioritorise the importance of justifying the relevance and benfits of research for participants.

CHAPTER SIX CONCLUSION
As a result of the explorations of my case study within four generations of one whnau 1 , from the questions I raised, I have gleaned insights into the lived understandings of whnau and childrearing in order to explain the intergenerational values and beliefs. My lead question about the reconstruction of the whnau model found me at the outset of the study searching literature and examining several works including the works of Spoonley in Mclennan et al (2000) and Durie in Te Whaiti et al (1997), who found that there was a general move away from the intergenerational whnau model, arguing 2 that the intergenerational whnau model was a barrier to industrialisation and capitalism because it was underpinned by principles of collectivism and reciprocity. Because of this, they said that it negated western values of competitiveness and individuality. Among the findings of the research project, I contest their argument and find in contrast that far from being an impediment to progress in a capitalist society, that those in the case study find the intergenerational whnau model to be the essence for survival for the concept of whnau and whanaungatanga. When I analyse what all participants had to say about the intergenerational whnau model, their comments indicate how fundamental the model is to shaping their perceptions of the survival and wellbeing of the whnau as a collective unit. Collectivism and reciprocity were essential features of being whnau and not viewed as barriers to their economic survival in the world of work. Another of my questions was interested in the context of generational studies and how individual and shared roles were perceived. Highlighted within the writings of Koopman-Boyden (1987) and Spoonley in Mclennan et al (2000) was the way our government adheres exclusively to the nuclear family model when they develop family policy within Aotearoa/New Zealand society. In my opinion, I conclude that such approaches to family and childrearing subjugate other cultural perspectives as being inferior to the nuclear family model. From my case study I clearly perceive that

107

Chapter Six

the participants find the intergenerational whnau model, despite the persistence of government to promote the nuclear family model, to be the preferred mode of family relationships. They referred to the wellbeing of whnau as being at the centre of their being Mori. In exploring the well-being of the whanau, and whether `being Mori' was a factor in the intergenerational model, another key question to the study concerned the tensions that arose as a result of the determination to be Mori in the whole colonising process. What is inherent in the stories of whnau members in the study was the constant tension they have to mediate in their lived experiences between the western philosophies of individualism and competitiveness and the benefits for individuals 3 and the philosophies of collectivism and reciprocity of benefit for all whnau members 4 . Through the relived stories of participants about their perceptions of whnau, hapu and iwi, their values and beliefs about whnau and childrearing were intrinsically linked to the significance and importance of whakapapa, which Buck (1950), Eruera in Salmon (1980), Pere (1994) and Walker (1990) all talk about as being the responsibility of whnau to nurture and teach children about. Most of the research participants, in particular, 4A, 3A and 2B focused on how they have pursued those intergenerational values and beliefs and how whakapapa was integral to their cultural identity. Linked to such identity was the place and importance of language which Buck (1950), describes as having a metaphoric nature. He explains that the Mori language exists within the cultural context of traditional Mori whnau units. I conclude from this that cognisance of the metaphors about language, requires educators and responsible whanau members to make a conscious effort to promote the metaphors about language such as `Ka ngaro reoreo tangata, Ko taatarakihi anake e kiikii mai 5 '.

Particularly prominent with second generation whnau members. The fourth and third generation members are philosophical and very articulate about their values and beliefs related to the collective wellbeing of the whnau as a unit and the intergenerational transmission of that knowledge. 5 A metaphor implemented as a prominent Khanga Reo philosophy meaning `if the voices of people die out/are lost, then only the cicadas will be left to speak for us'

Chapter Six

Historically the concept of whnau has survived because of its resilience to be able to keep up with change. While I believe that change and transformation will occur to reflect the values and beliefs which second generation members within my case study expressed in terms of the waning relevance of Maori language 6 , third and fourth generation whnau members need to lead with integrity and work to find ways to convince whnau of the philosophical and practical importance of accepting and passing on intergenerational whnau knowledge. I believe that the key to the strengthening and maintenance of the intergenerational model is through developing and promoting respectful, responsive and reciprocal relationships with whnau members underpinned by tikanga. Strong Mori whnau and childrearing practices of the past continue to be a legacy to us of the present and I believe, we have to embody and evolve those traditional philosophical hopes and aspirations to live by as whnau today and for our mokopuna and generations of mokopuna in the future: Kia t pakari, tu rangatira ia hei raukura mo tna whnau, tna hap, tna iwi Through such childrearing practices the intergenerational whnau model will continue to offer a robust structure of socialisation for the Mori family of the future.
