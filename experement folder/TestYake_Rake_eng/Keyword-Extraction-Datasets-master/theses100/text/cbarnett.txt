ABSTRACT

Otitis Media is one of the most common childhood diseases. Recurrent repeated acute otitis of media (RAOM) of is characterized middle ear by in episodes inflammation the

conjunction with middle ear fluid, and often with an inflamed or bulging eardrum. Defective clearance by the Eustachian tube results in mucus build-up and is characteristic of otitis media with effusion (OME). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus

influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, respiratory syncytial virus, and
rhinovirus are the most common contributors to otitis media pathogenesis. In New Zealand, OME has been implicated with conductive hearing loss in childhood and has been shown to significantly impact on speech and language development. New Zealand Maori and Polynesian children have displayed significantly higher hearing test failure rates than EuropeanCaucasian children. The collectins, Surfactant Protein (SP)-A and ­D are encoded by three genes (SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D) and are host defense proteins present in the middle ear and Eustachian tube. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SP-A1 and SP-A2 have been associated with increased or decreased susceptibility to otitis media, meningococcal disease, and range of respiratory diseases. Using allele-specific primers and real-time PCR with SYBR® Green I melting curve analysis, four groups of individuals were genotyped for eleven SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D SNPs: European-Caucasian individuals with RAOM/OME; New Zealand

Maori/Polynesian individuals with RAOM/OME; individuals with meningococcal disease; and a control group. The computer program, Haploview, was employed to perform 2 analyses and identify statistically significant associations of alleles/haplotypes with RAOM/OME or meningococcal disease. In the European-Caucasian population, two SP-A1 alleles, one

SP-A2 allele, and four haplotypes (CGAGC, 1A3, 1A9, and 1A10)
were found to be associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME (P < 0.05). Conversely, haplotypes 6A2 and 1A2 were found to be

protective against susceptibility to RAOM/OME (P < 0.05). In
New Zealand Maori and Polynesian individuals, two SP-A1 alleles, three SP-A2 alleles, one SP-D allele, and four haplotypes (6A8, 6A10, 1A3, and 1A10) were found to be associated with increased

risk of RAOM/OME (P < 0.05). An additional four haplotypes
(6A2, 1A0, 1A2, and TA) were determined to be protective against susceptibility to RAOM/OME (P < 0.05). However, protective

SPA1/SPA2/SPD haplotype 6A2-1A0-TA was significantly underrepresented in the New Zealand Maori and Polynesian population (P < 0.05). A single allele and haplotype were associated with

increased risk of meningococcal disease (P < 0.05).
The findings of this study confirm that specific genetic variants of SP-A and SP-D are associated with either increased or decreased risk of developing RAOM and/or OME. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that New Zealand Maori and Polynesian individuals appear to exhibit more haplotypes susceptible to RAOM/OME. This may provide a partial explanation for the higher RAOM/OME-related failure rates of hearing tests in New Zealand Maori and Polynesian children. However, there are numerous socio-economic and environmental factors that also contribute to otitis media pathogenesis which were not considered in this

study. The effects of the SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D alleles and haplotypes on the bacterial/viral binding efficiencies of SP-A and SP-D need to be investigated by further research, using a large population, to confirm the association with susceptibility or resistance with RAOM/OME.

INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW

1.1

Otitis Media

Otitis Media (OM) is one of the most common childhood diseases and is responsible for the majority of doctor's visits, antibiotic treatment, and related surgery for children in developed countries (Freid et al., 1998). Acute otitis media is characterized by rapid onset of inflammation of the middle ear and the presence of middle ear fluid, often coupled with an inflamed and/or bulging tympanic membrane (eardrum). Recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM) is regarded as at least three or four episodes of acute otitis media in the past six or twelve months, respectively. Evidence of serous or mucoid fluid in the middle ear, without acute symptoms, is characteristic of otitis media with effusion (New Zealand District Health Board, 2004). Otitis media often occurs secondary to respiratory infections and is mostly caused by bacterial and viral infections that start in the nasopharynx and rapidly spread through to the Eustachian tube and the middle ear cavity (Kodama et al., 2005) as depicted in Figure 1.1. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial pathogens responsible for otitis media, while respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus are the most predominant viral

During infection, the mucosa of the middle ear undergoes extensive hyperplasia where the monolayer of mostly simple squamous epithelium is transformed to a pseudostratified respiratory epithelium by the addition of cells, including goblet and ciliated cells (Ryan et al., 2005). Otitis media with effusion (OME) occurs when the mucociliary clearance system provided by the Eustachian tube becomes defective. Normally, the Eustachian tube clears the pathogen-binding mucus secretions produced by mucosal epithelial cells into the neighbouring nasopharynx, maintaining a healthy environment in the middle ear. However, when this system is compromised,

mucus production continues and builds up within the middle ear cavity (e.g. `glue-ear') often causing conductive hearing loss (Ryan et al., 2005). Current management of these conditions includes repeated courses of antibiotics and often operations to drain fluid and ventilate the middle ear. OME has been implicated in hearing loss which often occurs during the most critical stage of language development in childhood (National Audiology Centre, 2003). In New Zealand, the conductive hearing loss associated with bilateral OME has been shown to have a significant impact on language and speech development, reading ability, and classroom behaviour in children up to eleven years old (Chalmers et al., 1989). Results from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (1996) calculated that nearly 20% of New Zealand five year olds exhibited OME in at least one ear. A New Zealand hearing screening programme carried out between July 2001 ­ June 2002, found that the overall failure rates of tympanometry tests for new school entrants and three year olds were both 7.8%. However, three year old Pacific Island and Maori children had significantly higher failure rates compared to their European counterparts with 14.9% and 11.8% respectively. Maori and Pacific Island new school entrants had 12.1% and 17.1% failure rates (National Audiology Centre, 2003). Additionally, a recent longitudinal study of Pacific Island children living in New Zealand revealed that approximately 25% of Pacific Island 2 year olds suffered from acute otitis media or OME (Paterson et al., 2006). A variety of factors contribute to the pathogenesis of otitis media including: age, bacterial and viral exposure, innate and adaptive

Chapter One: Introduction and Literature Review

immunity status, Eustachian tube structure and function (Zheng

et al., 2006). A range of environmental factors such as day care,
season of year, older siblings, parental smoking, housing/crowding, and breast feeding influence an individual's level of pathogen exposure and immunity (Homoe et al., 1999; Rovers et al., 2004). Additionally, compelling evidence presented by Casselbrant et al (1999) suggested that otitis media susceptibility is genetically inherited. In their twin and triplet study, a significantly higher concordance rate of OME in monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic twins was observed.

1.2

Surfactant

In the lungs, a lipoprotein surfactant is synthesized to reduce the surface tension at the alveolar air-liquid interface and consequently prevents the lungs from collapsing. Pulmonary surfactant is composed of phospholipids (80%), cholesterol (~10%), and four surfactant proteins (~10%): SP-A, SP-B, SPC, and SP-D (McGuire, 2002). This surfactant and its associated proteins have also been found to be present in many other tissues, including oral epithelium; gastric and intestinal mucosae; mesothelial tissues; synovial cells; salivary glands; pancreas; reproductive and urinary tracts; Eustachian tube and middle ear mucosae (Bourbon and Chailley-Heu, 2001; Dutton et al., 1999). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) was found by Paananen and colleagues (2002) to be the main phospolipid in both Eustachian tube lavage fluid (ETLF) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). However, the molecular species of PC in each location was different: palmitoyloleoyl PC was the most prevalent in ETLF, and

Chapter One: Introduction and Literature Review

5

dipalmitoyl PC in BALF. This difference corresponded with a significantly reduced efficiency of the ETLF for lowering surface tension, suggesting that another function predominates for Eustachian tube surfactant. Eustachian tube epithelium is morphologically similar to lower airway epithelium and specialized microvillar epithelial cells have been identified which express and secrete the surfactant proteins, facilitated by cytoplasmic electron-dense granules, homologous to those seen in Type II pneumocytes located in pulmonary alveoli (Paananen et al., 2001). Evidence for the presence of SP-A and SP-D has been provided by in situ hybridization, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), electron microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy (Dutton et al., 1999; Paananen et al., 1999, 2001; Yamanaka et

al, 1991). In addition, SP-A was found to be the most abundant
surfactant protein in the middle ear, as also seen in pulmonary surfactant (Paananen et al., 2001). SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic proteins that are essential for lowering surface tension in the lungs by enhancing adsorption and spreading of surfactant phospholipids at the air-liquid interface (Nogee, 1998). A SP-B deficiency that occurs frequently in premature babies typically leads to lethal neonatal respiratory disease (Floros et al., 1995). Detection of SP-B and SP-C mRNAs in the middle ear has been performed with RT-PCR, however the presence of these proteins in the middle ear has not been confirmed and it has been proposed that they are lung-specific (Dutton et al., 1999).

1.2.1

Structure of SP-A and SP-D

In contrast, SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins and belong to the collectin family of calcium-dependent carbohydrate binding proteins, which also includes mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and conglutinin (Floros et al., 1998; Crouch et al., 2001). Members of the collectin family are characterised by N-terminal collagen-like domains and C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) which allows them to bind to various types of macromolecules, including carbohydrates, phospholipids, and proteins (Shepherd, 2002). Both SP-A and SP-D are oligomers of trimeric subunits (Crouch, 2000, 2001) as illustrated in Figure 1.2. SP-A has `bouquet-like' oligomers of the closely related chains SP-A1 and SP-A2, arranged as octadecamers with closely spaced CRDs (20nm). Both SP-A1 and SP-A2 protein molecules consist of 248 amino acids (aa) and usually only differ within the collagen-like domain: Met66, Asp73, Ile81, and Cys85 for SP-A1, and Thr66, Asn73, Val81, and Arg85 for SP-A2 (Karinch and Floros, 1995). SP-D (375 aa) exists as a dodecamer, with more widely spaced CRDs (100nm). Spacing between the CRDs in SP-D is five times greater than for SP-A, possibly contributing to the greater ability of SP-D to aggregate microbial ligands (Shepherd, 2002).

1.2.2

Function of SP-A and SP-D

Recent publications have established that SP-A and SP-D are important components of the innate immune system in the lungs (Crouch and Wright, 2001; Shepherd, 2002). They combat infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi by promoting destruction of these pathogens by phagocytic cells and it is therefore probable that they also play this role in the middle ear. It has been proposed that SP-A and SP-D promote phagocytosis by two different mechanisms (Ding et al., 2004). The first involves binding of the collectins to pathogens and promoting their recognition for phagocytic clearance by macrophages and neutrophils (Crouch and Wright, 2001).

Chapter One: Introduction and Literature Review

8

Both SP-A and SP-D are positively-charged proteins that can bind to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a negatively-charged cell wall component of all gram-negative bacteria, which consists of core oligosaccharides, an amphipathic lipid A domain, and a variable O-antigen polysaccharide domain. The C-terminal domains of SPA and SP-D interact in a Ca2+ and Na+ dependent manner with LPS at the lipid A domain and the core oligosaccharides/Oantigen domain, respectively, (Kalina et al., 1995; Sano et al., 1999; Van Iwaarden et al., 1994). In addition, it was observed that SP-D uses its CRD to bind to lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PepG) in a calcium-dependent manner. LTA and PepG are major cell wall components of gram-positive bacteria which can induce an inflammatory response and in some cases, initiate septic shock (van der Wetering et al., 2001). In the same study, SP-A did not bind to LTA or PepG in a specific manner, but it was hypothesized that the protein may interact with other glycoconjugates present on the cell wall surface. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have examined the interactions between SP-A and SP-D with microbial pathogens including H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, Influenza A virus, and respiratory syncytial virus, confirming that they can be bound, aggregated, and promoted for phagocytosis by the collectins (Crouch et al., 1998, 2000, 2001). SP-D was also found to aggregate and/or bind to several bacterial strains of

pneumoniae and found that both recombinant truncated SP-D
and native full-length SP-D bound to all strains of bacteria. One study using SP-A null mice found delayed pulmonary clearance of H. influenzae and respiratory syncytial virus (LeVine and Whitsett, 2001). However, the addition of purified SP-A enhanced the binding and uptake of respiratory syncytial virus by peripheral blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages (Barr

et al., 2000). Furthermore, they found SP-A also had an effect
on the macrophage production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis-factor alpha, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10. The second mechanism by which SP-A and SP-D may facilitate destruction of pathogens involves a direct interaction between SP-A or SP-D and the phagocytic cells themselves, stimulating their activity. Schagat and co-workers (2001) determined that SP-A and SP-D could bind to polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), which are recruited to a specific site of infection and undergo apoptosis, by which resident dramatically increases their phagocytosis macrophages. Furthermore,

intrapulmonary administration of truncated human recombinant SP-D also reduced the amount of apoptotic and necrotic alveolar macrophages in a SP-D null mouse model (Clark et al., 2002). Enhanced removal of apoptotic macrophages in an area of inflammation, e.g. Otitis media, is necessary for returning the affected tissue back to normal, as extended exposure to the expelled components of apoptosis can prolong inflammation and hinder the healing process (Matalon and Wright, 2004). In addition, there has been evidence to suggest that SP-A and SP-D may also interact and/or stimulate members of the

Chapter One: Introduction and Literature Review

10

adaptive immune system. Both native and recombinant forms of SP-A and SP-D were shown to interact with recombinant Tollwhich detect specific pathogen associated like receptors (TLR) 2 (Murakami et al., 2002) and TLR4 (Ohya

et

al.,

2006),

molecular patterns (PAMPS) and modulate cytokine expression (Bohlson et al., 2007). Nadesalingam and colleagues (2005) employed ELISA to reveal that SP-D binds to various types of immunoglobulins, including secretory-IgA, IgE, IgG, and IgM. It was also determined that SP-D binds to IgG in a calciumdependent manner, aggregates IgG-coated beads and enhances their phagocytosis by mouse-derived macrophages. These results therefore suggest SP-D as a mediator of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Overall, the literature provides evidence that both SP-A and SPD facilitate the destruction of various bacteria and viruses that are commonly known to cause otitis media in the middle ear. Not only do these collectins contribute to innate immunity in the middle ear but they also interact with the adaptive immune system in order to alleviate infection and inflammation in an attempt to restore tissue homeostasis.

1.2.3

SP-A and SP-D genes

The human SP-A locus has two functional, highly homologous genes (SP-A1 and SP-A2) in opposite transcriptional orientation with one pseudogene between these two genes. They are all located at chromosome 10q22-q23 in a cluster along with the SP-D and MBL genes (Kishore et al., 2006) as shown in Figure 1.3.

Chapter One: Introduction and Literature Review

11

Physical and radiation hybrid mapping has provided evidence that SP-A1, SP-A2, SP-D, and the SP-A pseudogene (MBL1P1) are in linkage disequilibrium (Floros et al., 1996; Hoover and Floros, 1998). Interestingly, baboons are the only other species to have two SP-A genes, whilst all other mammals have only one SP-A gene. Floros and colleagues (1993, 2005) speculated that gene duplication may have occurred approximately 26 million years ago due to greater demands imposed upon the organism as a consequence of an increasing number of pathogens, irritants and other environmental challenges. In contrast to previous publications, the latest reference copy of the human genome shows two copies of both SP-A1 and SP-A2 approximately 300kb apart, but only a single copy of SP-D (Ensemble Human, release 40). This evidence suggests that individuals may have different gene copy numbers of SP-A1 and

SP-A2, possibly leading to gene dosage effects. However, the
effects of SP-A1 and SP-A2 copy number variations on the expression of these genes, and any association with disease, has not yet been investigated.

1.2.4

Association of SP-A and SP-D with disease

Some alterations in SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D are known to be associated with a range of pulmonary diseases. For example, it was determined that a methionine at amino acid position 11 in SP-D (Lahti et al., 2002) and a lysine at residue 223 in SP-A2 (Lofgren et al., 2002) are associated with severe infection by respiratory syncytial virus, a common respiratory tract pathogen of infancy. Saxena and co-workers (2003) identified two exonic and two intronic polymorphisms in the collagen region of SP-A1 and SP-

A2 that were significantly associated with increased risk of
allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. A tryptophan at amino acid position 219, instead of arginine in SP-A1, was found to be significantly related to the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Selman et al., 2003). Certain genetic variants of

SP-A1

and

SP-A2

were

overrepresented in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome, a major cause of newborn mortality and morbidity (Ramet et al., 2000). Similar results were obtained by Seifart and colleagues (2005) who found that some SP-A1/SP-A2 variants including were small associated cell lung with risk for pulmonary cancer, and carcinoma, adenocarcinoma,

squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, specific SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D alleles correlated with increased or decreased risk for tuberculosis (Floros et al., 2000), and decreased levels of the proteins have been detected in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (Postle et al., 1999).

Chapter One: Introduction and Literature Review

14

This observation may explain the compromised pulmonary innate immunity commonly seen in cases of cystic fibrosis. A recent study investigated the distribution of polymorphisms in

SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D among patients diagnosed with
meningococcal disease (Jack et al., 2006). They found that a lysine instead of a glutamine at amino acid position 223 of SP-A2 was associated with increased risk of meningococcal disease. However, variations in SP-A1 and SP-D were not associated with increased or decreased risk of the disease. This research project proposes that any unfavourable change in the ability of SP-A and SP-D to deal with the pathogens previously discussed, and others, may predispose an individual to middle ear infections and persistent middle ear effusions. Such a change could occur within the protein's coding DNA, where a single nucleotide substitution may result in an altered protein primary sequence, thus affecting the protein's ability to bind and aggregate its targets.

1.3

Genetic diversity of SP-A and SP-D

Human SP-A1 and SP-A2 exhibit extensive genetic heterogeneity across individuals (Floros et al., 2005). This has been seen in the range of 5' untranslated exon splice variants, sequence variability in the 3' untranslated region (UTR), and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding regions. Karinch and Floros (1995) investigated the alternative splicing of the four 5' UTR exons (A-D) in SP-A1 and SP-A2, and found that all possible variants for both genes were translated in vivo. However, the relative levels and translation efficiency of the splice variants differed amongst individuals, with AD' presenting as the most

Chapter One: Introduction and Literature Review

15

frequent splice variant for SP-A1 and ABD for SP-A2. Wang and co-workers (2005) later found that 5' UTR splice variants of SP-

A1 and SP-A2 also modulate mRNA stability, with four specific
variants enhancing gene expression. In addition, sequence variations in the 3' UTR were also found to influence the expression of SP-A1 and SP-A2 (Wang et al., 2003). However, 5' UTR splice variants and 3' UTR sequence variants of SP-D, and their influence on expression and translation have not yet been fully characterized.

SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D have all been found to be polymorphic
(Liu et al., 2003; Pantelidis et al., 2003). Gelehrter and colleagues (1990) considered a particular locus to be polymorphic if the less frequent allele has a population frequency of no less than 1%, and a heterozygosity frequency of at least 2%. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occur when a single nucleotide (purine or pyrimidine) in a DNA sequence is substituted with a different nucleotide. A SNP may either result in a synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid substitution, where the amino acid coded for is the same or different, respectively (Crawford and Nickerson, 2005). The linkage of SP-A1, SP-A2, SP-D, and MBL1P1 allows for all the polymorphisms to be assembled into haplotypes: combinations of alleles of different SNPs along the same chromosome which can be inherited as a unit (Crawford and Nickerson, 2005). As

Homo sapiens are diploid, each individual has two haplotypes for
a particular part of their genome, corresponding to the paternal and maternal chromosomes. The SNP loci making up a particular haplotype on a chromosome will be passed on from parent to offspring as a unit unless separated by recombination.

Chapter One: Introduction and Literature Review

16

The probability of recombination occurring within a haplotype partially depends on the physical distance between the SNP loci. Closely spaced loci are therefore less likely to be separated and are described as being in linkage disequilibrium. Consequently, if the genotype of one SNP is known, the genotype of another SNP may be predicted if there is a high level of linkage disequilibrium between the two SNPs. This research project investigated previously described SNPs in the SP-A and SP-D genes as depicted in Figure 1.4.

Within the exons of SP-A1 there have been five biallelic SNPs documented, corresponding with amino acid positions 19, 50, 62, 133, and 219 (DiAngelo et al., 1999). Two of these SNPs are silent (aa62 and aa133), whereas the remainder result in nonconservative amino acid substitutions, as described in Table 1.1. Observed patterns of the SNPs from previously published research have provided 19 and 15 haplotypes for SP-A1 (6An)

Chapter One: Introduction and Literature Review

17

and SP-A2 (1An), respectively (DiAngelo et al., 1999). However, only four SP-A1 haplotypes and six SP-A2 haplotypes made up almost 99% of the haplotypes present in the Finnish population (Hoover and Floros, 1998; Rämet et al., 2001).

Within the SP-A2 there are three exonic SNPs which result in a non-synonymous amino acid change: aa9, aa91, aa223. While at aa140, a synonymous change can occur (Table 1.2).

1.3.1

SP-A Haplotypes

A previous study by Rämet et al. (2001) reported a difference in the frequencies of specific SP-A haplotypes between Finnish children diagnosed with recurrent otitis media and a control population. Using a PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphism technique to detect the SNPs in SP-A1 and SP-A2, they found an over-representation of the 6A4-1A5 haplotype within the recurrent otitis media patients. A subset of infants who had their first diagnosed case of acute otitis media before the age of six months also had an under-representation of the 6A2-1A0 haplotype. In addition, the frequency of the homozygous SP-A1 haplotype 6A2/6A2 was significantly greater in the case population than the control population. However, contrasting findings were presented by Pettigrew and co-workers (2006) in an American population. Amongst a subset of American-Caucasian infants, the 6A4-1A5 haplotype was protective against Otitis media, corresponding with a 76% reduced risk during the first twelve months of life. They also determined that the SNP at codon 19 in the SP-A1 gene was associated with prevalence of otitis media. An alanine at position 19 corresponded with a significantly greater chance of otitis media within the first year of life.

Chapter One: Introduction and Literature Review

20

The allele and haplotype frequencies for SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D within a New Zealand population are currently unknown. Given that the prevalence of RAOM/OME is a significant problem in European-Caucasian children, and even more so in New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island children, it is important to characterize whether changes in an individual's SP-A and SP-D are associated with their susceptibility to RAOM/OME.

1.4

Genetic Techniques and Data Analysis

The present research project investigated the association of the eleven previously described SNPs in SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D, as single markers (SNPs) and as haplotypes, in patients who presented with recurrent acute OM (RAOM) and/or OM with effusion (OME) at Waikato Hospital (Hamilton, New Zealand). Volunteers donating blood at the New Zealand Blood Service (Waikato) Donor Centre comprised the control group for the study. Using allele-specific primers and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with SYBR® Green I melting curve analysis, DNA samples from patients undergoing surgery for RAOM/OME were screened for the minor and/or major alleles for each SNP. Genotype and haplotype frequencies for both populations were calculated and compared.

1.4.1 Real-time

Real-time PCR PCR is a rapid and high-throughput molecular

technique for amplification of a particular region of DNA between

Chapter One: Introduction and Literature Review

21

two predetermined positions, and is distinguished by its high level of sensitivity. The chemistry of PCR results from the action of the enzyme DNA

Taq polymerase,

originating

in

the

thermophile Thermus aquaticus, a bacterium that inhabits hotsprings and therefore expresses heat-stable enzymes. DNA amplification is facilitated by the addition of Taq polymerase to a reaction mix containing template DNA and primers (oligonucleotides) complementary to sequences flanking either side of the target region. The reaction is then exposed to a program of temperature cycles as described below: The first cycle begins with an initial denaturation step at a high temperature which promotes the double stranded DNA (dsDNA) to dissociate into single strands. The temperature is reduced to a level less than the melting temperature of the primers to allow for annealing. The annealing step facilitates the hybridization of the primers to their complementary sequences on the single stranded template DNA. The allele-specific primers used in this present study were designed with the 3' end nucleotide complementary to the nucleotide variants at a particular SNP location. In order to circumvent the appearance of spurious smaller sized amplicons in the PCR product spectrum, Don et al. (1991) devised a simple strategy that involved increasing the annealing temperature of the PCR. Their proposed solution assumed that the problem was due to mispriming by one or both of the oligonucleotide primers with the target template or with each other; and due to their smaller size these are preferentially amplified, with the effects compounding during reaction cycling.

Chapter One: Introduction and Literature Review

22

This also suggests that the mispriming annealings are less stable than the specific ones due to different degrees of mismatch. Don

et al. proposed that any difference in the melting

temperature between the incorrect and the correct annealings would give an advantage of 2x/cycle, or 4x/°C, to the correct product, all else being equal. By initially increasing the annealing temperature to 10°C greater than the expected annealing temperature, followed by a reduction (`touchdown') of 1°C per cycle for 11 cycles (e.g. 65-55°C), the correct product will be amplified before the smaller, spurious product, therefore obtaining a competitive edge that will be maintained for the rest of the thermal cycling. Following the touchdown annealing step, the temperature is raised to the optimum temperature for Taq polymerase activity, where the enzyme uses the primers as starting points for synthesising DNA complementary to the region specified. The heating/cooling steps are repeated for approximately 40 cycles and, theoretically, at the end of each cycle the number of DNA strands containing the target sequence should have doubled, resulting in millions of copies of the region of interest. The addition of a fluorescent dye which binds to dsDNA (e.g. SYBR® Green I) to the reaction allows the researcher to observe the amplification of the target sequence in real-time, given that the accumulation of fluorescence is proportional to the accumulation of amplification products (Higuchi et al., 1993) as shown in Figure 1.5.

SYBR® Green I Melting Curve Analysis

Previously utilized techniques for the detection of single base changes in particular regions of the genome included PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and gel electrophoresis. More recently, due to their high level of sensitivity and visualisation, fluorescence-based methods have found favour within the scientific community.

The fluorescence data obtained was subsequently translated into melting curves by removal of background fluorescence and any confounding influence of temperature on fluorescence, then plotted (Figure 1.6) as the negative derivative of fluorescence, dF, with reference to temperature, T, (Ririe et al., 1997).

The presence of a peak at the appropriate melting temperature (~90°C) for the major allele, but not for the minor allele indicates that the individual is homozygous for the major allele. B) Melting curves for an individual which show detection of both the major and minor alleles for the SNP; both reactions show a PCR product peak with a melting temperature of 90°C, thus suggesting heterozygosity. The amplified target regions for both alleles differ by only one nucleotide, therefore they have similar melting temperatures and the peaks are almost perfectly superimposed.

tool of many medical association studies in recent years. This has since led to the establishment of the Human Haplotype Map project (HapMap) which allows for genotype data to be available to all medical genetics researchers (International HapMap Consortium, 2003). Raw genotype data from both the case group and the control group for SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D were analyzed, interpreted, and visualized using the software package, Haploview (Barrett et

analyzes the amino acid change by investigating 3D protein structures, multiple alignments of homologous sequences, and amino acid contact information from a range of protein structure databases, and then estimates position-specific independent counts (PSIC) scores for each of the two variants (major and minor). The difference in the PSIC scores between the two variants is then calculated. The greater the PSIC score difference, the greater the putative functional effect the amino acid change will have on the protein (Ramensky et al., 2002).

Study Objectives

1.5.1

Objective One

Investigate whether a significant difference in population allele and haplotype frequencies, for all eleven markers in SP-A1, SP-

A2, and SP-D, exists between the case (patients with RAOM or
OME) and control populations. 1.5.2 Hypothesis One

It was hypothesized that specific alleles and haplotypes of SP-

A1, SP-A2 and SP-D would be more or less frequent in the
RAOM/OME individuals, confirming findings of previous studies (Pettigrew et al., 2006; Rämet et al., 2001). 1.5.3 Objective Two

Compare observed SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D alleles and haplotype frequencies between the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island case population and the control population. 1.5.4 Hypothesis Two

It was hypothesized that allele and haplotype frequencies would be significantly different between the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island case population and the control population. In addition, it was expected that this population would exhibit more RAOM/OME associated alleles and haplotypes than the total case population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1

Blood Samples

Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the University of Waikato School of Science and Engineering Human Research Ethics Committee and the Northern Y Regional Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health (Ethics Reference Number: NTY05/05/030). Ethical approval information is presented in Appendix I. Four millilitre blood samples were obtained from 136 patients undergoing surgery involving ventilation tube insertion of the tympanic membrane at Waikato Hospital and Southern Cross Hospital, Hamilton, New Zealand. Blood samples from a control population were obtained from 160 participants donating blood at the New Zealand Blood Service (Waikato) Donor Centre, Hamilton, New Zealand. Additionally, blood samples from three patients diagnosed with meningococcal disease were obtained. Informed consent was obtained from each participant and basic personal and medical details were recorded including: age; sex; ethnicity; operation type; previous number of ventilation tubes inserted; presence of right and left middle ear fluid; previous adenoidectomy; and professional medical diagnosis. Blood samples were stored in EDTA containing Vacutainer® tubes (BD) at 4°C until used for isolating genomic DNA.

Chapter Two: Materials and Methods

2.1.1

Isolation of Genomic DNA

Genomic DNA from each blood sample was isolated for use in this study using the following protocol: Labelled 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tubes (Axygen) were filled with 1 ml of sterile MQ-H2O (Barnstead), 130 l of 10x red blood cell (RBC) lysis solution (1.44 M NH4Cl, 0.1 M NH4HCO3, 1 mM Na2EDTA), and 250 l of each blood sample. Tubes were placed onto a rotator wheel (Labinco) for 5 - 10 minutes until lysis of the RBCs, indicated by a reduction in turbidity, and then centrifuged (5415R Bench Top Centrifuge, Eppendorf) at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes. After centrifugation, the supernatant and most of the RBC membranes were carefully pipetted off to leave a white pellet containing the white blood cells, at the bottom of the tube. The pellet was resuspended in the remaining solution, followed by the addition of 300 l of DNA lysis buffer (0.1 M Tris pH 9, 0.05 M EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, 1% (w/v) SDS). After thorough mixing, the tubes were placed in a thermomixer (Eppendorf) at 95°C for 5 - 10 minutes. Once removed from heat, 300 l of 5 M lithium chloride (Ajax Chemicals) was introduced. The tubes were shaken vigorously and then placed onto the rotator wheel again for approximately 10 minutes. After mixing, 750 l of chloroform (Ajax Chemicals) was added and the solutions vortexed for 20 seconds to form an emulsion before being returned to the rotator wheel for a further 15 - 30 minutes. The tubes were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the phases. The top phase containing the DNA (approximately 500 l) was transferred using a transfer pipette to a new labelled tube along with an equal volume of isopropanol

Chapter Two: Materials and Methods

(Ajax Chemicals), inverted to mix and then left overnight to allow DNA precipitation. On the following day, the tubes were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes, gathering the precipitated DNA at the bottom of the tube. The alcohol was carefully poured off the pelleted DNA and washed with 70% v/v ethanol (Ajax Chemicals). Using an autopipette, the remaining ethanol was removed from the bottom of the tube, avoiding the white DNA pellet, and the pellet then air dried. Finally, 50 l of tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TE: 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA pH 8) buffer was added to each tube and mixed at 37°C for 30 minutes to dissolve the DNA.

2.1.2

DNA Concentration and Integrity

DNA concentration and purity of each sample was determined by using 2 l for analysis using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop). The concentration of nucleic acids in each sample was measured by absorbance at 260 and presented as ng/l. The ratio of sample absorbance at 260 and 280 nm was used to assess the purity of the DNA. A 260/280 ratio of 1.8 ­ 2.0 was considered ideal. The genomic DNA samples were then stored at 4°C until required.

2.2

Genotyping of SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D.

Based on previous publications (Pantelidis et al., 2003), allelespecific primer pairs were synthesized (Sigma-Aldrich) with the 3' end nucleotide complementary to the wild-type or mutant

solutions (forward and reverse primers) were made for both alleles to a 20 pmol/l concentration.

2.2.1

PCR Optimization

Optimal annealing temperatures and extension times for each set of allele-specific primers were determined using gradient PCR. Twenty-five microlitre reactions were made with PCR mastermix (10x HotMaster® Reaction Buffer (Eppendorf), 250 M deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Invitrogen), 2.5 mM MgCl2 pH 8.5), 0.5 U of HotMaster® Taq DNA Polymerase (Eppendorf), 10 pmol of allele-specific primers, and approximately 200 ng of genomic DNA. DNA Taq polymerase synthesized DNA complementary to the template at approximately 1000 bp per minute during the extension step of the thermocycling program, thus it was necessary to group allele-specific reactions based on similar PCR product base-pair lengths. Accordingly, the 22 allele-specific reactions were divided into three groups, with estimated optimal extension times (Table 2.2).

Chapter Two: Materials and Methods

Thermocycling was conducted using a Peltier Thermal Cycler (PTC) 200 (MJ Research) and consisted of the following steps: 1. 2. 3. 4. Initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 minutes 94°C for 20 seconds Annealing temperature gradient of 52 - 64°C Extension: i) ii) iii) 5. 6. Group One: 68°C for 40 seconds Group Two: 68°C for 30 seconds Group Three: 68°C for 60 seconds

Repeat steps 2 - 4 in 39 more cycles Final extension at 68°C for 5 minutes

2.2.2

Agarose Gel Electrophoresis

Gradient PCR products were then electrophoresed to determine which annealing temperature produced the most efficient amplification of the target genomic region. A 2% (w/v) agarose gel (USB) was cast with 1x sodium borate buffer (0.05 M boric acid, 0.01 M NaOH pH 8.5) and 1.5 g/ml of ethidium bromide using a Owl gel electrophoresis system. Ten microlitres of the amplified product from each PCR reaction was loaded into the wells of the gel. The products were then electrophoresed for 30 minutes at 120 V and 30 mA. Product bands were visualised using a GIBCO BRL ultra-violet transilluminator (Life Technologies) at 312 nm, photographed using a COHU High Performance CCD camera and printed with a Sony Digital Graphic Printer UP-D890. Confirmation of product band base-pair lengths were made by comparison with a 100 bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen).

Chapter Two: Materials and Methods

37

The optimal annealing temperature for each set of allele-specific primers was determined by the presence of a single high intensity product band in the agarose gel at the appropriate base-pair length, and the absence of extra bands of other inappropriate lengths.

2.2.3

Real-Time PCR

Real-time PCR reactions were performed in 100 l thin walled tubes (Corbett Research) and monitored using a Rotor-GeneTM 6000 (Corbett Research). Each 20 l reaction mixture contained Real-time PCR Mastermix (10x Thermostart® Reaction Buffer (AB Ltd), 1/20,000 dilution of SYBR® Green I (Invitrogen), 250 M deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Invitrogen), 5 mM MgCl2 pH 8.5), 0.5 U of ABGene Thermostart® DNA Polymerase (AB Ltd), 5 pmol of allele-specific primers, and approximately 200 ng of genomic DNA. Touchdown thermocycling steps were as follows: 1. 2. 3. Initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 mins 94°C for 20 seconds Annealing temperature started at 70°C for 20 seconds and then decreased at 1°C/cycle for 20 seconds for the first 15 cycles, staying at 56°C for the remaining cycles 4. 5. 6. Extension at 68°C for 30 ­ 60 seconds (Table 4) Fluorescence acquisition step at 80°C for 15 seconds (excitation at 470 nm, detection at 510 nm) Repeated steps 2 - 5 in 44 more cycles

2.2.4

SYBR® Green I Melting Curve Analysis

Following amplification, PCR products were heated from 75°C to 99°C in 0.5°C increments every 5 seconds. The denaturing conditions dissociated the dsDNA into single strands as the melting temperatures (Tms) were reached for each specific PCR product. The consequential reduction in fluorescence from the release of the SYBR® Green I dye was detected, and the derivative of the raw data produced a melt curve, with the peak representing the Tm for the product. The absence or presence of the appropriate melt curves were used to assign whether the wild-type, mutant, or both alleles were present in an individual's genome. Real-time PCR products were analyzed by 2% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis as previously described in section 2.2.2, and product band lengths noted to confirm that the correct target genomic region had been amplified.

2.2.5

Sequencing of SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D PCR Products

Sequencing of the allele-specific PCR products amplified from SP-

A1, SP-A2, and SP-D was also employed to confirm that the
correct region had been targeted and that no incorrect amplification had occurred. Genomic DNA from sample M1 (meningococcal group) and case sample 26 was used as a template for amplification of the 22 (two alleles for each SNP) previously described alleles in SP-A1,

SP-A2, and SP-D by PCR. Fifty microlitre reactions consisted of
PCR mastermix (10x HotMaster® Reaction Buffer (Roche), 250

M deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Invitrogen), 2.5 mM MgCl2 pH 8.5), 0.5 U of HotMaster® Taq DNA Polymerase (Eppendorf), 10 pmol of allele-specific primers, and approximately 200 ng of genomic DNA. The thermocycling protocol for amplification of the 22 alleles was as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. Initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 minutes 94°C for 20 seconds 60°C for 20 seconds Extension: i) ii) iii) 5. 6.

39 more cycles of steps 2 - 4 Final extension at 68°C for 5 minutes

Following thermocycling, all PCR products were purified by selective precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 as previously published by Schmitz and Riesner (2006). The amount of reagents added to each 50 l reaction was different for each group of allele-specific reactions, as seen in Table 2.3.

Following addition of the purification reagents, the solutions were mixed well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Post-incubation, the solutions were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 minutes to allow the DNA to sediment. The supernatant was then removed and the remaining DNA pellet washed with 125 l of 70% (v/v) ethanol. Finally, the ethanol was also removed and the pellet solubilized in 15 l of deionised water. The solutions were then sent to the University of Waikato Sequencing Laboratory (Hamilton, New Zealand) for sequencing, using the allele-specific primers. Product sequences for each allele-specific reaction were entered into the NCBI website in FASTA format to facilitate a BLAST search which allowed confirmation that the correct region within forward and reverse primers as sequencing

SP-A1, SP-A2, or SP-D had been amplified.

Analysis of Genotype Data

Raw genotype data for both the case and control populations were analyzed with Haploview software (Barrett et al., 2005). A simple tab-delimited text file (.txt) containing sample numbers, gender, case/control status, and SNP genotypes were input into Haploview. A separate input file which contained the names and chromosomal position for each SNP was also loaded. Initially, the software performed a number of SNP genotyping quality measures with including the percentage of individuals These successfully genotyped for each particular SNP, and a test of conformance Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. parameters were then used to filter out any SNPs which fell below a preset threshold.

2.3.2

2-Tests for RAOM/OME Association

Simple 2-tests for single SNPs and the constructed haplotypes were carried out to calculate any association with recurrent acute otitis media or otitis media with effusion.

2.3.3

Protein Phenotype Predictions

The amino acid sequences of SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D were entered into the PolyPhen server (Ramensky et al., 2002) in FASTA format. Individually, the sequence position and the two amino acid variants for each SNP were included, from which the software could identify any deleterious alleles. To calculate whether the substitution in question occurred at a specific site, PolyPhen used: the TMHMM (Krogh et al., 2001) algorithm to predict transmembrane regions, the Coils2 program (Lupas et al., 1991) to predict coiled coil regions, the SignalP program (Bendtsen et al., 2004) to predict signal peptide regions of the protein sequence. Using a BLAST search of the non-redundant database (NRDB), homologues of the input protein sequences were identified and used by the PSIC software to calculate profile scores for the allelic variants at each SNP position. The difference between the scores of both variants was calculated. A further BLAST search of the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000) and the Protein Quaternary Structure database (Henrick and Thornton, 1998) for homologues allowed PolyPhen to estimate whether the

Chapter Two: Materials and Methods

43

substitutions affected the hydrophobic core of the protein and/or electrostatic and ligand interactions. The DSSP database (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) provided information on the proteins' secondary structures and solvent accessible areas. Finally, PolyPhen analyzed the various structural properties and profile scores obtained to compare the protein variants, and predict whether the structural and functional consequences of the minor allele at each particular SNP were benign or damaging.

RESULTS

3.1

Isolation of Genomic DNA

Genomic DNA was isolated from 4 ml blood samples from 136 patients with recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM) or otitis media with effusion (OME), 160 control participants, and 3 meningococcal disease patients. Sample information is presented in Appendix II. The DNA was resuspended in 50 l of TE buffer and 5 l loaded into a 2% (w/v) agarose gel and electrophoresed, as depicted in Figure 3.1. Migration of the genomic DNA through the agarose gel, followed by ethidium bromide staining and UV visualization allowed for band intensity analysis. From this information, a crude estimation of the sample DNA concentration could be made.

In order to obtain accurate measurements of DNA concentration and integrity, 2 l of each sample was analyzed by a Nanodrop® ND-1000 spectrophotometer. A small subset of spectrophotometer results are presented in Table 3.1. The nucleic acid concentration for each genomic DNA sample was given in ng/l, and sample absorbance was measured at 230 nm, 260 nm, and 280 nm. The ratio of a sample's 260 nm and 280 nm absorbance measurements were used to determine the purity of the DNA sample. A 260/280 ratio of greater than or equal to 1.8 was considered "pure" DNA, and devoid of contaminants.

Gradient PCR

To determine the optimal annealing temperature for the allelespecific primers used to amplify the major (Mj) and minor (mi) alleles for each SNP, gradient PCR was used. During the

Chapter Three: Results

46

thermocycling, the peltier thermal cycler (PTC-200) established a temperature gradient across the plate where the reactions are placed. Identical reactions for all 22 allele-specific primers were placed into the PTC-200 which provided a temperature gradient between 52°C ­ 64°C at the annealing step. Once the thermocycling was completed, 10 l of each reaction was loaded into a 2% (w/v) agarose gel supplemented with ethidium bromide and electrophoresed as previously described in section 2.2.2. Migrated PCR products were then visualized with a UV transilluminator and compared to a 100 bp DNA ladder, from which product band intensity, length and quality could be determined. Figures 3.2 ­ 3.4 show the results of the gradient PCR for the allele-specific primers targeting regions in SP-A1,

SP-A2, and SP-D in one sample.

Identical 25 l PCR reactions were run at different annealing temperatures (52.0 ­ 63.8 °C), and 10 l of each reaction was loaded into a 2% agarose (w/v) gel and electrophoresed. Single product bands of 605 bp, 959 bp, and 959 bp were expected, respectively. Lane N: negative template control; Lane L: 100 bp ladder.

Spurious smaller bands were present in most reactions at an annealing temperature of 52.0°C. For example, the primers that targeted the SP-A1 allele, 62G (Figure 3.2), amplified the correct 959 bp region and five smaller regions, ranging between 150 ­ 450 bp. However, the presence of these smaller erroneous bands diminished as the annealing temperature was increased, with

Real-Time PCR and SYBR® Green I Melting Curve Analysis

Case and control DNA samples were genotyped for the major and minor alleles for the SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D SNPs using real-time PCR and SYBR® Green I melting curve analysis. Separate real-time PCR reactions were made for detection of the

Chapter Three: Results

52

major and minor alleles, and the products melted slowly between 75 - 99°C. The resulting melt curve for each reaction was used to determine whether the alleles were present or absent. Figures 3.5 ­ 3.15 show the melt curves produced for both the major and minor alleles for each SNP. The PCR products for each allele had precise melting temperatures (Tm) influenced by product length and GC% (GC pairings have three hydrogen (H)-bonds, while AT pairings have only two H-bonds to dissociate) thus allele-specific melt curves could be distinguished from other spurious products due to mispriming. The primers that amplified the major and minor alleles for each SNP differed only by the final 3' end nucleotides, which were homologous for the corresponding allele present in an individual's genome. Amplification of the targeted region only occurred if the correct allele was present for the specific primers used. Therefore, the PCR products for both the major and minor alleles of a particular SNP were almost identical in size and melting curve Tm. For example, Figure 3.5 shows the melt curves for the allele-specific primers SPA1-19T (Mj) and SPA119C (mi) for control samples 144 ­ 148. The Tm for both the major and minor allele PCR products was approximately 91.75°C, however nonspecific product curves can also be seen between 82 - 90°C.

Samples 128 (A) and 129 (B) had identical genotypes for the SNPs occurring at amino acids 19, 50, and 219 in SP-A1, and amino acid 223 of SP-A2. Negative template controls (NTCs) for 19C, 19T, 50C, and 50G are shown in lanes N1 ­ N4. The NTCs for the remaining four allele-specific primers were not run on the gel as they produced no melting curves during the SYBR® Green I melting curve analysis.

Samples 128 and 129 were found to be heterozygous for the major/minor alleles at codons 19 and 50 of SP-A1, as indicated by allele-specific product bands in the agarose gel depicted in Figure 3.16. However, a cytosine (Mj) only was detected at codon 223 of SP-A2 for both samples. Furthermore, an allelespecific band representing SPA1-219T (mi) was apparent for

sample 128 only, while SPA1-219C (Mj) was detected in sample 129. Multiple product bands were seen in some lanes of the agarose gel (Figure 3.16). The smaller spurious products corresponded with the nonspecific products seen in the lower temperatures of the SYBR® Green I melting curve analysis, as depicted in Figures 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, and 3.13. Real-time PCR products for case samples 128 and 129 with the allele-specific primers SPA2-9A/C, SPA2-91G/C, SPA2-140C/T, and SPD-11T/C were also electrophoresed in a 2% (w/v) agarose gel and are presented in Figure 3.17.

Samples 128 (A) and 129 (B) were found to have identical genotypes for the SNPs at amino acids 9, 91, and 140 in SP-A2, and amino acid 11 in SP-D. NTCs for 9A, 9C, 91G, and 91C are shown in lanes N1 ­ N4. NTCs for the remaining four primers were not run on the gel, and did not produce a SYBR® Green I melt curve.

It was confirmed from the agarose gel that both samples 128 and 129 were heterozygous at SNP loci SPA2-9 and SPD-11. Sample 128 was also heterozygous at SPA2-140 but only a cytosine (Mj) could be detected in sample 129. Allele-specific product bands in the gel were only seen for the minor allele (91C) of SPA2-91, in both the samples.

Confirmation by DNA Sequencing

SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D allele-specific PCR products amplified
from meningococcal sample M1 and RAOM/OME sample 26 were purified by selective precipitation with polyethylene glycol 6000 (Schmitz and Riesner, 2006). The 22 (two alleles for eleven SNPs) purified PCR products were then sequenced, using the allele-specific forward and reverse primers as sequencing primers, in order to confirm that the correct genomic regions were being amplified by the allele-specific primers. The regions amplified by the major and minor allele-specific primers for each SNP (e.g. SPA1-19T and SPA1-19C) were identical. The forward primers differed only in the final 3' end nucleotide which is complementary to the appropriate allele, while the reverse primers were identical. Therefore, the complementary strands produced by DNA polymerase are the same for both the major and minor allele-specific primers. Subsequent BLAST searches with the obtained sequences confirmed that the regions amplified by the allele-specific primers were from the correct locations within SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D. DNA sequencing and BLAST search results are presented in Appendix III.

Raw Genotype Results

Following completion of real-time PCR and SYBR® Green I melting curve analysis, case and control population genotyping results for each of the eleven SNPs in SP-A1, SP-A2 and SP-D were collated in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. A subset of this data is shown in Table 3.4.

In addition, Haploview is often used to analyze pedigree data and requires information on each individual's Father and Mother. However, for non-pedigree data,

Chapter Three: Results

like that obtained in the present study, pedigree information was filled with a zero value. For each of the eleven SNPs screened the concluding genotypes were recorded in the import file. For example, Figure 3.18 shows that case sample 1 has the genotype `4 2' for the SP-A1 SNP at amino acid 19. Haploview encodes nucleotides with corresponding numbers (1= A, 2= C, 3= G, 4= T), thus the genotype `4 2' represents `T C'. This means that both alleles could be detected in that particular individual's genome and is therefore heterozygous at the SNP locus. A summary of the Haploview analysis process is shown in Figure 3.19.

European-Caucasian Population Statistics presents the genotyping and Hardy-Weinberg

equilibrium statistics generated by Haploview for the SP-A1, SP-

A2, SP-D SNPs within the European-Caucasian case population of
RAOM/OME patients (N = 136). All of the individual SNPs were at least 97% successfully genotyped, except for SPA1-62A/G, which was 94.8% successfully genotyped across the case population. The sum of the major and minor allele population frequencies

(MjAF and MAF) for a particular SNP equals one (Equation 1.0), and if that SNP is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Equation 2.0) in the population, then the observed genotype frequencies should simply be a function of the relative allele frequencies. MjAF + MAF = 1 MjAF2 + 2(MjAF x MAF) + MAF2 = 1 (Equation 1.0) (Equation 2.0)

Equation 2.0 states that the frequency of homozygous major allele individuals (MjAF2), heterozygous individuals (2(MjAF x MAF)), and homozygous minor allele individuals (MAF2) also adds up to one. Predicted proportions of heterozygosity for the SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D SNPs were then calculated using the observed minor allele frequency (MAF) and Equation 3.0 (derived from Equation 2.0): Predicted SNP heterozygosity = 2(MjAF x MAF) (Equation 3.0)

Chapter Three: Results

68

Observed proportions of SNP heterozygosity were then compared to their predicted values, and any significant deviations (P < 0.0001) indicated that the alleles of that particular SNP were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Within the European-Caucasian case population, minor allele frequencies for a particular SNP locus ranged between 0.160 (SPA1-219C/T) and 0.485 (SPA1-50G/C). The mean minor allele frequency was 0.319 ± 0.086 standard deviation (SD). In addition, ten of the eleven SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. However, the SP-A1 50G/C polymorphism had an observed heterozygosity frequency of 0.328, which was significantly lower than the expected value of 0.500 (P < 0.0001) and was thus not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

Haploview analyzed the raw genotype data and determined the levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between each of the eleven SNP loci, as illustrated in Figure 3.20. Levels of LD were presented as: D' (measure of LD between two SNP loci)/ LOD (logarithm of the odds for LD between the two SNP loci).

values given in each square represent: D' (measure of LD between two SNP loci)/ LOD (logarithm of the odds for LD between the two SNP loci). A value of D'/LOD = 100 indicates complete LD and suggests that the two SNPs have not been separated by recombination. Values of D'/LOD < 100 imply incomplete LD and indicate that the ancestral LD was disrupted during the population's history. Dark grey squares represent higher levels of LD, while light grey or white squares represent lower levels of LD.

A value of D'/LOD = 100 indicated complete LD and suggested that the two SNPs had not been separated by recombination. Values of D'/LOD < 100 implied incomplete LD and indicated that the ancestral LD had been disrupted during the population's history. The highest levels of LD were seen between SPA150/SPA1-219 (D'/LOD = 88), SPA1-50/SPA2-9(D'/LOD = 87),

and SPD-11/SPD-160 (D'/LOD = 88). However, very low levels of LD were observed for both SPA1-19 and SPA1-133 when compared with each other and the remaining SNP loci. Following LD analysis, haplotype blocks were constructed for each of the genes SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D based on the genotyping data from individuals in the European-Caucasian case population (Figure 3.21).

(CGAAC) and 6.5% (TGAGC) of the European-Caucasian case population. All other SP-A1 haplotypes were found in 36.4% of the population. The most predominant SP-A2 haplotype, 1A0 (AGCC) was found in 42.8% of the European-Caucasian case population. The other commonly seen haplotypes included 1A5 (CCTC, 9.1%), 1A1 (CGTA, 7.4%), 1A (CCCC, 7.1%), and 1A9 (AGTC, 6.0%). All remaining haplotypes combined to make up 27.6% of the SP-A2 haplotypes. Of the four possible SP-D haplotypes, three were present in similar proportions: TA (36.1%), CG (32.2%), and TG (30.2%). In contrast, the remaining haplotype, CA, was found in only 1.5% of the European-Caucasian case population. The SP-A1-SP-A2-SP-D haplotype 6A2-1A0-TA was observed in over 10% of the European-Caucasian case population, as illustrated by the thick black lines in Figure 3.21. Furthermore, many other

Table 3.6. Quality statistics for the SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D, SNP loci genotyped in the control population. Observed (ObsHET) and predicted (PredHET) heterozygosity values were calculated for each SNP loci. Significant deviations from the predicted heterozygosity estimates were determined by the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p value (HWpval < 0.0001) and highlighted in bold font. The percentage of non-missing genotypes for each SNP loci was calculated (%Geno). The minor allele (M.A.) for each SNP loci and their corresponding population frequencies (MAF) were also presented.

SNP minor allele frequencies ranged between 0.116 (SPA1219C/T) and 0.422 (SPD-160G/A). The mean minor allele frequency was 0.265 ± 0.107 SD. Similar to the European-Caucasian case population, ten of the

SP-A1,

SP-A2,

and

SP-D

SNPs

were

in

Hardy-Weinberg

equilibrium. However, in this instance it was the SPA2-91G/C polymorphism which had an observed heterozygosity frequency of 0.176. This value was significantly lower than the expected heterozygosity frequency of 0.298 (P < 0.0001).

As with the European-Caucasian case population, LD analysis was performed by Haploview to determine the levels of LD between the eleven SNP loci in the control population (Figure 3.22). Similar patterns of LD were observed in the control population in comparison to the European-Caucasian case population. The highest levels of LD were found between SPA1-50/SPA1-219 (D'/LOD = 83), SPA1-62/SPA1-219 (D'/LOD = 84), SPA1219/SPD-160 (D'/LOD = 80), and SPD-11/SPD-160 (D'/LOD = 88). Complete LD was observed in the analysis of SPA1-62 and SPA2-223 (D'/LOD = 100). In addition, the lowest levels of LD were again seen in the assessments of SPA1-19 and SPA1-133, with the remaining SNP loci in the control population.

Figure 3.22. Linkage disequilibrium plot of the eleven SNPs in SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D detected within the control population. The values given in each square represent: D' (measure of LD between two SNP loci)/ LOD (logarithm of the odds for LD between the two SNP loci). A value of D'/LOD = 1 indicates complete LD and suggests that the two SNPs have not been separated by recombination. Values of D'/LOD < 1 imply incomplete LD and indicate that the ancestral LD was disrupted during the population's history. Dark grey squares represent higher levels of LD, while light grey or white squares represent lower levels of LD. D'/LOD values of 100 are not shown and are represented by a blank square.

As shown in Figure 3.23, the most frequent SP-A1 haplotypes found in the control population included 6A2 (TGAAC, 39.9%), 6A3 (TCAAC, 16.5%), CGAAC (7.9%), and 6A4 (TCGAT, 4.6%). However, the haplotype 6A (CCGGC) was also found in 3.9% of the population. All other SP-A1 haplotypes were found in 27.2% of the population.

Approximately half of all the individuals in the control population exhibited the SP-A2 haplotype, 1A0 (AGCC, 49.9%). Other common haplotypes presented were 1A2 (CGCC, 10.7%), 1A1 (CGTA, 8.8%), 1A5 (CCTC, 7.9%), and 1A (CCCC, 5.7%). All remaining haplotypes combined to make up 17% of the SP-A2 haplotypes.

Similar to the European-Caucasian case population, the SP-D haplotype CA was found in only 1.6% of the control population. Haplotypes TA, CG, and TG were found to contribute 40.6%, 30.0%, and 27.8%, respectively. The

SP-A1-SP-A2-SP-D

haplotype

6A2-1A0-TA

was

observed in over 10% of the control population, as illustrated by the thick black lines in Figure 3.23. However, 6A2-1A0-TG and 6A2-1A0-CG were also found in over 10% of the control individuals.

and

genotype/haplotype frequencies in both the individuals with RAOM/OME and the control population, Haploview was further employed to investigate if there was any significant difference of these values between the two populations. If a significant difference in genotype/haplotype frequencies was seen between the two populations, it would indicate an association between that particular allele/haplotype with RAOM/OME. Initially, Haploview compared the major and minor allele frequencies for each SNP in the case and control populations. Using Chi square (2) analysis, significant differences were identified (P < 0.05) therefore suggesting an association between a particular allele and RAOM/OME (Table 3.7).

haplotypes

previously

constructed by the Haploview software. The associations of the

SP-A1 haplotypes with RAOM/OME are presented in Table 3.8. SP-A1 haplotypes 6A2 and CGAGC were found to be associated
with RAOM/OME. Haplotype 6A2 was found to be underrepresented in the European-Caucasian case population (24.9%) in comparison to the control population (38.9%). This population frequency difference was determined statistically significant (2 = 12.813, P = 3.00 x10-4). The population frequency of the haplotype CGAGC was also significantly different, with 5% in the European-Caucasian case population and 3.6% in the control population (2 = 6.932, P = 0.0085). All other haplotype population differences were not statistically significant i.e. P > 0.05).

New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island Population Statistics

Twenty-two of the individuals diagnosed with RAOM/OME were of New Zealand Maori or Pacific Island descent. This subset of individuals population were in compared to see by if Haploview there are to the control order any additional

allele/haplotype associations with RAOM/OME which may explain their higher population incidence of RAOM/OME (Paterson et al., 2006). Table 3.11 outlines the observed and predicted SNP

heterozygosity; percentage of SNP genotyping; and minor allele statistics. Nine of the eleven SNPs were completely genotyped for the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island case population, while SP-A1 SNPs at codons 50 and 62 were 95.5% successfully genotyped.

The minor allele frequency for a particular SNP ranged between 0.25 (SPA1-133 and SPD-160) and 0.477 (SPA2-9 and SPA2140). The mean minor allele frequency was 0.352 ± 0.084 SD.

Observed (ObsHET) and predicted (PredHET) heterozygosity values were calculated for each SNP loci. Significant deviations from the predicted heterozygosity estimates were determined by the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p value (HWpval < 0.0001). The percentage of non-missing genotypes for each SNP loci was calculated (%Geno). The minor allele (M.A.) for each SNP loci and their corresponding population frequencies (MAF) were also presented.

The differences between the predicted and observed values of heterozygosity for each SNP were determined to be not statistically significant, therefore suggesting that all the SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.001).

Following evaluation of SNP genotyping and Hardy-Weinberg statistics, the levels of LD between each pair of SNPs were calculated. The results from the LD analysis are shown in Figure 3.24. Complete LD (D'/LOD = 100) was observed between five pairs of SNPs: 223,

In common with both the European-Caucasian case and control populations, the most frequent SP-A1 haplotype (37.6%) found in the New Zealand Maori/Pacific Island case population was 6A2 (TGAAC). This was followed by haplotypes 6A3 (TCAAC, 15.6%), CGAAC (6.6%), 6A11 (CCAAC, 6.4%), and 6A4 (TCGAT, 5.2%).

The remaining haplotypes identified contributed to 28.6% of the population. Again, the predominant SP-A2 haplotype previously seen in both the European-Caucasian case and control populations, 1A0 (AGCC), was also the major haplotype in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island case population (45.6%). Haplotype 1A1 (CGTA) was detected in 9.7% of the population. The next most common haplotypes 1A5 (CCTC), 1A2 (CGCC), and 1A (CCCC) were found in 8.7%, 8.5%, and 7.4% of the population, respectively. The remaining SP-A2 haplotypes identified made-up 20.1% of the total number of haplotypes found. The three SP-D haplotypes TA, TG, and CG were found in 38.6%, 30.6%, and 29.3% of the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island case population. The remaining 1.5% of individuals displayed the haplotype CA. In addition, SP-A1-SP-A2-SP-D haplotypes 6A2-1A0-TA and 6A21A0-TG were both shown to be present in over 10% of the individuals from the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island case population.

In common with the European-Caucasian case population, an adenine at codon 223 of SP-A2 was also associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME in New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals in comparison to the control population (2 = 8.198, P = 0.0042). However, the association of a cytosine and a guanine at codons 19 and 133 of SP-A1, respectively, previously seen in the European-Caucasian case population was not found in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island case population. In addition to the allele 223A, two other SP-A2 alleles were more frequent in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island case population: 91C and 140T. A cytosine at codon 91 of SP-A2 was

present in 38.6% of the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals but only 18.2% of the control individuals (2 = 9.790, P = 0.0018).

SP-A1 alleles 50C and 219T were found to be over-represented
in the New Zealand Maori/Pacific Island case population, compared to the control population. A cytosine at codon 50 was detected in 73.8% of the New Zealand Maori/Pacific Island individuals, but was much less frequent in the control population (39.9%: 2 = 17.285, P = 3.22 x10-5). Within the New Zealand Maori/Pacific Island individuals, 31.8% were found to carry a thymidine at codon 219 of SP-A1, while only 11.6% of the control individuals had the same allele (2 = 13.173, P = 3.00 x10-4). In the European-Caucasian case population, none of the SP-D alleles were found to be over- or under- represented and were therefore not associated with RAOM/OME. However, in the New Zealand Maori/Pacific Island case population a guanine at codon 160 of SP-D was detected in 75% of the individuals. This minor allele was significantly less frequent in the control population, with 57.8% exhibiting a guanine at codon 160 (2 = 4.757, P = 0.0292), indicating that this allele is associated with an increased risk of RAOM/OME in New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals.

In common with the earlier haplotype analysis of the EuropeanCaucasian case population, under-representation of the SP-A1 haplotype 6A2 was also seen in the New Zealand Maori/Pacific Island case population (39.7%). (9.2%), compared that to the control population Thus suggesting the particular

haplotype is protective against RAOM/OME (2 = 15.560, P = 8.00 x10-5). Two SP-A1 haplotypes, 6A8 and 6A10, were found to be significantly more frequent in the New Zealand Maori/Pacific Island case individuals in comparison to the control population (P < 0.05).

In the European-Caucasian case population, the SP-A2 haplotype 1A2 was the only haplotype found to be under-represented (P < 0.05). However, both 1A2 and 1A0 were found to be significantly less common in the New Zealand Maori/Pacific Island case population than the control population.

population and control population, respectively (2 = 8.361, P = 0.0038). On the other hand, SP-A2 haplotypes 1A3 and 1A10 were overrepresented in the European-Caucasian case population, and this finding was repeated in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island case population. Haplotype 1A3 was found in 7% of the New Zealand Maori/Pacific Island case individuals, but only 0.9% of the control individuals (2 = 8.896, P = 0.0038). Similarly, haplotype 1A10 was present in 7.7% of the New Zealand Maori/Pacific Island case individuals and 0.8% of the control individuals (2 = 11.51, P = 7.00 x10-4). None of the SP-D haplotypes were found to be significantly associated with RAOM/OME in the previous analysis of the European-Caucasian case population. However, in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island case population the haplotype TA was under-represented, indicating that it has a protective function against RAOM/OME (Table 3.15). Approximately 20% of New Zealand Maori/Pacific Island individuals diagnosed with RAOM/OME had a thymidine and an adenine at codons 11 and 160, correspondingly. However, this quantity was significantly higher in the control population, with 40.6% of the individuals displaying the haplotype TA (2 = 5.480, P = 0.0192).

Association with Meningococcal Disease

Three individuals diagnosed with meningococcal diseases were also genotyped for the eleven

SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D

polymorphisms, and the findings are presented in Table 3.16. Sample M1 was found to be heterozygous for both the major and minor alleles at three SP-A1 loci (codons 19, 50, and 62), two

SP-A2 loci (codons 9 and 223), and the two SP-D loci (codons 11
and 160). Only the major allele was detected at codon 219 of

SP-A1, and codon 140 of SP-A2. However, sample M1 was
homozygous for the minor allele at SPA1-133 and SPA2-91. At eight of the eleven SNP loci, sample M2 was determined to be homozygous for the major allele. In contrast, this individual was heterozygous for both alleles at SNPs SPA1-50, SPA1-133, and

SPA2-9.

Out of the eleven alleles analyzed by Haploview, only one was determined to differ significantly in frequency between the meningococcal and control individuals. An adenine at codon 160 of SP-D was detected in 83.3% of the meningococcal individuals but was present in only 42.2% of the control population (2 = 4.069, P = 0.0437).

PolyPhen predicted that the polymorphisms that would result at non-synonymous changes at amino acids 19 and 50 would have a benign effect. In other words, such changes would not have a significant deleterious effect on the translated SP-A1's structure and function. In contrast, it was predicted that a tryptophan substituted for an arginine at amino acid position 219 would probably have a damaging effect on SP-A1's structural and functional attributes. The FASTA amino acid sequence for SP-A2 (Homo sapiens) seen in Figure 3.27 was also subjected to Polyphen analysis.

CHAPTER FOUR

DISCUSSION

4.1

Background

The prevalence of recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) in the general population is assumed to exhibit an underlying normal distribution (Kvestad et al., 2003a). Some individuals are more susceptible to such infections and are placed at the far right tail of the bell-shaped curve, while others are more resistant and are placed at the far left tail of the bell-shaped curve. Despite the extreme phenotypes at either end, the majority of the population sits in the middle of the bellshaped curve near the population mean number of episodes of AOM/OME per person per year. Though a variety of environmental and socio-economic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of otitis media (age, bacterial and viral exposure, innate and adaptive immunity status, Eustachian tube structure and function), substantial evidence indicates that susceptibility to otitis media can also be inherited (Casselbrandt et al., 1999; Kvestad et al., 2003b). Casselbrandt and co-workers conducted a twin and triplet cohort study to determine the genetic component of time with and episodes of middle ear effusion and AOM during the first two years of life. They estimated of heritability of time with middle ear effusion was 0.73 (P < 0.001) during this time period. Previous studies have implicated polymorphisms in the two genes for the surfactant-related protein SP-A with susceptibility

Chapter Four: Discussion

or resistance to otitis media (Pettigrew et al., 2006; Rämet et

al., 2001). SP-A and it's closely related collectin-family member
SP-D are host defense proteins which are expressed in the lungs, middle ear, and a range of other mucosae (Bourbon and Chailley-Heu, 2001; Dutton et al., 1999). They contribute to host immunity by binding and aggregating Gram-negative and Grampositive bacteria or viruses, and enhancing their destruction by phagocytes (Crouch et al., 1998, 2000, 2001; Crouch and Wright, 2001; Ding et al., 2004; Shepherd, 2002). SP-A and SPD also interact with and/or stimulate members of the adaptive immune system to further combat pathogen infection e.g. RAOM/OME in the middle ear (Bohlson et al., 2007; Murakami et

al., 2002; Nadesalingam et al., 2005; Ohya et al., 2006).
Biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms in SP-A1, SP-A2, and

SP-D have been identified which result in either synonymous or
non-synonymous amino acid substitutions in the translated protein. Additionally, all three genes are in linkage disequilibrium and thus haplotypes can be constructed from the alleles found at each of the SNP loci (Floros et al., 1996; Hoover and Floros, 1998). As recombination occurs less often than expected in regions in linkage disequilibrium, haplotypes can be inherited as units. Certain SP-A1 and SP-A2 alleles and haplotypes have been correlated with increased or decreased host susceptibility to otitis media (Pettigrew et al., 2006; Rämet et al., 2001). No previous research has linked SP-D alleles or haplotypes with otitis media. In a Finnish population, Rämet and colleagues (2001) analyzed DNA from forty-seven children diagnosed with acute otitis media (AOM) and 147 children with RAOM for SP-A haplotypes. Using a previously described PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism-based method they compared the SP-A1 and SP-

A2 haplotype frequencies from the case groups with 228
individuals from the general population. The haplotypes found were composites of alleles from single nucleotide polymorphisms at codons 19, 50, 62, 133, and 219 of SP-A1 and at codons 9, 91, 140, and 223 of SP-A2. SP-A1 haplotypes are denoted with 6Am and SP-A2 haplotypes with 1An. As SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D are in linkage disequilibrium, such haplotypes can be combined e.g. 6Am-1An. Rämet et al. identified statistically significant differences in haplotype frequencies between the case and control populations with 2 analysis. The haplotype 6A4-1A5 (TCGAT-CCTC) was found to be over-represented in both the AOM (P = 0.02) and RAOM (P = 0.003) groups. Additionally, the AOM group exhibited an under-representation of the 6A2-1A0 (TGAAC-AGCC) haplotype (P = 0.03). In an American study, 355 infants at risk for developing asthma were genotyped to evaluate the association between the same

SP-A1 and SP-A2 loci as described above, and risk of otitis media
during the first year of life (Pettigrew et al., 2006). They demonstrated that the major allele, an alanine at codon 19 of SP-A1 corresponded with a significantly greater chance of otitis media within the first year of life (2, P = 0.01). They further determined that Caucasian infants with an alanine at SP-A1 codon 19 were >3.8 times more likely to have otitis media in the first year of life, in comparison to those with a valine at that position. Alleles at codons 19, 62, and 133 in SP-A1, and 223 in SP-A2 were found to be differentially distributed across Caucasian, Hispanic, and African-American infants.

Chapter Four: Discussion

107

In decreasing order of frequency, the most common SP-A1 haplotypes found by Pettigrew et al. in the Caucasian infants were 6A2, 6A3, 6A4, and 6A. Again in decreasing order, haplotypes 1A0, 1A1, 1A2, 1A, 1A5, 1A6, and 1A3 were the most frequent SP-A2 haplotypes detected. In complete contrast to the findings of Rämet et al. Caucasian infants with haplotype 6A4-1A5 were associated with a 76% decreased risk of otitis media during their first year of life (OR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.07 ­ 0.73). In this study, eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding regions of SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D were genotyped in 160 unaffected individuals (control population) and in 136 individuals diagnosed with recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM) or otitis media with effusion (OME), in order to identify any associated alleles/haplotypes. The SNP loci investigated were situated at codons 19, 50, 62, 133, and 219 of SP-A1, and codons 9, 91, 140, and 223 of SP-A2. Lastly, SNPs at SP-D codons 11 and 160 were examined. Out of the eleven loci investigated, single nucleotide changes at all but three resulted in non-synonymous amino acid changes. Substitutions at SPA162, SPA1-133, and SPA2-140 resulted in synonymous amino acid changes. It was hypothesized that specific alleles and haplotypes of SP-A1, SP-A2 and SP-D would be more or less frequent in the RAOM/OME individuals, confirming the findings of previous studies (Pettigrew et al., 2006; Rämet et al., 2001). The most common SP-A1 haplotypes found in descending order in this study's European-Caucasian RAOM/OME population were 6A2 (TGAAC), 6A3 (TCAAC), CGAAC, 6A4 (TCGAT), and TGAGC. Appropriate nomenclature for haplotypes CGAAC and TGAGC was unknown. Most frequent SP-A2 haplotypes in this population were 1A0 (AGCC), 1A5 (CCTC), 1A1 (CGTA), 1A (CCCC), and 1A9

Chapter Four: Discussion

108

(AGTC) in descending order of frequency. In the control population the most common SP-A1 haplotypes, in decreasing order, were 6A2 (TGAAC), 6A3 (TCAAC), CGAAC, 6A4 (TCGAT), and 6A (CCGGC). The most common SP-A2 haplotypes in the same population were 1A0 (AGCC), 1A2 (CGCC), 1A1 (CGTA), 1A5 (CCTC), and 1A (CCCC). In both the case and control populations, SP-D haplotypes TA, CG, and TG were most frequently seen while haplotype CA was present in less than 2% of each population. Specific SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D alleles and haplotypes found to be associated with host susceptibility or resistance to RAOM/OME are presented in the following sections.

4.2.1

Three specific alleles were found to be over-represented in the European-Caucasian population of individuals diagnosed with RAOM/OME: SPA1-19C, SPA1-133G, and SPA2-223A. In SP-A1, an alanine (major allele) at codon 19 was associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME (P = 0.0045). Codon 19 is located in the N-terminal of SP-A1, the region responsible for interacting with other SP-A1 and SP-A2 molecules to form trimeric subunits and higher order multimers. An amino acid substitution at codon 19 from an alanine (major allele) to a valine (minor allele) may affect how successfully SP-A1 forms trimeric subunits and octadecamers; however, no evidence has

Chapter Four: Discussion

109

been published to support this hypothesis. Leth-Larsen and colleagues (2005) separated purified human SP-D by gel filtration chromatograghy and identified the components using atomic force microscopy. They found that multimers, dodecamers, and monomers of subunits displayed a higher level of binding to intact influenza A virus, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria than did SP-D monomers. However, monomers of SP-D preferentially bound isolated LPS. The researchers postulated that differences in the proportions of trimeric subunits and higher order multimers of SP-D in individuals were associated with differential activation of antiand pro-inflammatory signalling pathways and consequently affected the efficiency of inflammatory response and subsequent clearance of microbes. However, they conducted no further research to test this hypothesis. Such SP-D findings could also potentially apply to SP-A1 in the context of the middle ear. For example, the non-synonymous amino acid change in the N-terminal of SP-A1 may have a deleterious effect on the protein's ability to form trimers and multimers, which could subsequently reduce their ability to clear the bacteria/viruses involved in RAOM/OME pathogenesis. Unfortunately, these ideas are purely speculative as no research has investigated the effects of an alanine at SP-A1 codon 19 on the protein's structural and functional characteristics. Polyphen analysis (http://www.bork.embl-heidelberg.de/PolyPhen) employed in this study predicted that such a change would have a benign effect on SP-A1's structure and function. Using 3D protein structures, multiple alignments of homologous sequences, and amino acid contact information from a variety of protein structure databases, the differences between the two

Chapter Four: Discussion

110

protein variants were investigated by PolyPhen and deemed nonsignificant (Ramensky et al., 2002). The major allele of SPA1-133, situated in the collagenous region of SP-A1, was also determined to be associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME (P = 3.00 x10-4). However, this result was unexpected considering that a synonymous amino acid substitution occurs and has no functional effect on the gene product; the nucleotides guanine and adenine at this locus both encode a threonine. The substitution was predicted by PolyPhen to not have a significant effect on SP-A1's structure and function. Perhaps the presence of the nucleotide guanine (major allele) rather than an adenine (minor allele) at the SNP locus allows for additional CpG methylation, a trait of heterochromatin and repressed gene expression. A reduction in gene expression would therefore result in reduced SP-A1 in the middle ear and Eustachian tube which may subsequently lead to increased host susceptibility to infection by the common respiratory bacteria and viruses known to cause RAOM/OME. Research investigating the levels of CpG methylation in the SP-A1 region and subsequent gene expression is currently nonexistent, therefore further investigation is needed to assess whether changes to

SPA1-133 have any influence on SP-A1 expression.
Finally, the presence of a lysine (minor allele) at amino acid position 223 of SP-A2 was found in significantly more RAOM/OME individuals compared to the control population (P = 0.0038). This over-representation in the case population indicated an association with an increased risk for RAOM/OME. Similar results were seen in the research conducted by Lofgren and co-workers (2002) that compared the frequencies of SP-A1 and SP-A2 alleles in a population of children with severe respiratory syncytial virus

Chapter Four: Discussion

111

(RSV) bronchiolitis and a control population. Among patients with severe RSV infection, a lysine at codon 223 of SP-A2 was also significantly over-represented (0.28 vs. 0.18; OR = 1.78; 95% CI = 1.1 - 2.9; P = 0.023). Lofgren et al. (2002) postulated that because amino acid 223 is in the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of SP-A2, perhaps the substitution of the neutral amino acid glutamine (with an amidic side chain), for a cationic lysine (with a basic side chain), may alter the protein's affinity for microbial carbohydrate moieties. This explanation could also apply to the association of a lysine at SP-A2 codon 223 with increased risk of RAOM/OME. It is possible that having a lysine at this particular position in the CRD may reduce the protein's ability to bind to or interact with the cell wall components (e.g. LPS, LTA, and PepG) of gramnegative and gram-positive bacteria known to contribute to RAOM/OME pathogenesis, and facilitate their clearance from the middle ear and Eustachian tube. On the other hand, changes to the CRD may affect Despite how these SP-A can interact with no polymorphonuclear neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, and immunoglobulins. possible explanations, conclusive evidence is available that implicates a lysine at SP-A2 codon 223 with reduced pathogen binding and/or immunesignalling. Again, PolyPhen predicted no significant structural or functional effect on SP-A2.

4.2.2

SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D Haplotypes

The previously uncategorized SP-A1 haplotype CGAGC was overrepresented in the RAOM/OME case population (P = 0.0085). This haplotype contains an alanine (major allele) at SP-A1 codon

Chapter Four: Discussion

112

19, and a guanine (major allele) at codon 133, both of which were earlier shown to be associated with increased risk for RAOM/OME. It is possible that the presence of these two alleles and their hypothetical effect on SP-A1's pathogen binding and clearance capabilities leads to increased host susceptibility to RAOM/OME; however, no experimental work is available to confirm this theory.

SP-A2 haplotypes 1A3 (AGTA), 1A9 (AGTC), and 1A10 (CCTA)
were all over-represented in the RAOM/OME population in comparison with the control population (1A3, P = 0.0182; 1A9, P = 0.044; 1A10, P = 0.0391). Haplotype 1A3 contains an asparagine (major allele), alanine (minor allele), serine (minor allele), and lysine (minor allele) at codons 9, 91, 140, and 223 of SP-A2. Interestingly, Lofgren and associates (2002) observed that haplotype 1A3 was significantly over-represented amongst infants with severe RSV infection in comparison with a control group (0.05 vs. 0.005; OR = 10.44; 95% CI = 1.3 ­ 83.2; P = 0.006). This haplotype was also implicated as being associated with increased susceptibility to infection with the intracellular pathogen

Mycobacterium

tuberculosis, by Floros and colleagues (2000). However, the
functional and structural influences of haplotype 1A3 on SP-A2 are currently unknown. The rare haplotype 1A9 encodes an asparagine (major allele) at codon 9, alanine (minor allele) at codon 91, serine (minor allele) at codon 140, and a glutamine (major allele) at codon 223. The reason why this particular haplotype is associated with an increased risk of RAOM/OME is unclear since no association with the individual alleles was previously seen. Despite the fact that none of the individual alleles were associated with RAOM/OME,

Chapter Four: Discussion

113

perhaps, when present together, they have a synergistic effect on SP-A2's structure and function, consequently leading to increased host susceptibility to the development of RAOM/OME. Seifart et al. (2005) found that haplotype 1A9 was associated with increased risk for non-small cell lung carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. The researchers also conducted a methylation assay and found that the human

SP-A

promoter

was

hypomethylated in lung cancer, indicating that SP-A1 and SP-A2 expression is enhanced in lung cancer. It is possible that in the middle ear of an individual with SP-A2 haplotype 1A9, hypomethylation of the SP-A promoter also occurs and leads to excess expression of SP-A1 and SP-A2. However, no current research can provide evidence of this. Overproduction of SP-A1 and SP-A2 could possibly lead to a heightened inflammatory state in the middle ear, as SP-A activates pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression by macrophages and interacts with other immune related cells in an attempt to combat bacterial/viral infection. However, if a prolonged state of inflammation was established in the middle ear it potentially could maintain RAOM/OME for a period of time exceeding the presence of contributing pathogens, leading to inflammatory-related cellular damage e.g. free radical damage. Further research is needed to determine the influence of haplotype 1A9 on SP-A2 expression and the functionality of the gene product. The amino acids encoded at the four SP-A2 loci for haplotype 1A10 were: threonine (minor allele), proline (major allele), serine (minor allele), and lysine (minor allele). A lysine at SP-A2 codon 223 was determined earlier to be associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME. Therefore, the presence of this amino acid in

Chapter Four: Discussion

114

haplotype 1A10 may be responsible for the association between the haplotype and RAOM/OME. On the other hand, a proline often facilitates the conformation of random coils and -turns in a polypeptide chain. The carbon ring in proline's R group is bound to the amino group in the polypeptide backbone and therefore cannot participate in hydrogen bonding, which is vital for formation of some secondary structures. Perhaps in SP-A2 the presence of a proline at codon 91 prevents maintenance of a different secondary structure, which might have a detrimental effect on the protein's ability to bind and clear pathogens or interact with other immune-related cells/molecules. However, PolyPhen analysis undertaken for this study did not predict any significant detrimental affect of a proline at SP-A2 codon 91. Further protein structure experimentation needs to be conducted to demonstrate what functional changes occur as a result of SP-A2 haplotype 1A10. Finally, in addition to the four SP-A2 haplotypes found to be associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME, the power of the significance of haplotype 1A0 (AGCC, P = 0.0524) was on the threshold borderline of 0.05. If deemed to be significant, haplotype 1A0 would have been under-represented in the RAOM/OME population. However, in the RAOM/OME case population, SP-A1 haplotype 6A2 was detected in combination with SP-A2 haplotype 1A0 in over 10% of the population. Since haplotype 6A2 was determined to be protective against RAOM/OME, it is possible that haplotype 1A0 would also have a protective effect. Rämet and colleagues (2000, 2001) found that the 6A2/1A0 haplotypes were under-represented in infants with their first episode of AOM before six months of age (2, P = 0.03) but over-represented in infants with respiratory distress syndrome (OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.09 ­ 2.54; P = 0.018). It is

Chapter Four: Discussion

115

possible that if larger populations were genotyped for haplotype 1A0 then the frequency difference between the case and control populations would be determined to be statistically significant (P < 0.05). Alternatively, the discrepancy seen may be due to the absence of genotyping replicates. Rämet et al. (2001) also uncovered an over-representation of the 6A4-1A5 haplotype in the AOM infants (2, P = 0.02) and in RAOM infants (2, P = 0.003). These findings were in contrast to those of Pettigrew et al. (2006) who determined that the 6A4-1A5 haplotype was actually under-represented, and hence associated with a decreased risk of otitis media during the first year of life (OR = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.07 - 0.73). However, no significant difference in the 6A4-1A5 haplotype frequency was found in this current study's case population in comparison with the control population; therefore confirmation of either Rämet et al. or Pettigrew et al.'s findings was not possible. No association between any of the four SP-D haplotypes and increased risk of RAOM/OME was found in the case population studied.

Chapter Four: Discussion

116

4.3.2

SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D Haplotypes

The SP-A1 haplotype 6A2 (TGAAC) was under-represented in the population consisting of patients with RAOM/OME in comparison to the control population (P = 3.00 x10-4), thus suggesting a protective effect against RAOM/OME. Haplotype 6A2 encodes a valine (minor allele), valine (minor allele), proline (minor allele), threonine (minor allele) and an arginine (major allele) at codons 19, 50, 62, 133, and 219 of SP-A1. Identical results were obtained by Rämet et al. (2001) who found that infants with their first episode of AOM diagnosed before six months of age showed an under-representation of the 6A2 haplotype alone (2, P < 0.05), and in conjunction with the SP-A2 haplotype 1A0 (2, P = 0.03). On the other hand, Lofgren et al. (2002) found that the haplotype 6A2 was associated with increased risk of severe RSV infection when linked with the SP-A2 haplotype 1A3 (5.2 vs. 0.5, OR = 10.4; 95% CI = 1.3 - 83.2; P = 0.006), but not when analyzed alone. The apparent protective effect of haplotype 6A2 may potentially originate from the absence of an alanine at amino acid position 19 of SP-A1. This allele was previously found to be associated with an increased risk of RAOM/OME, possibly due to changes in the ability of SP-A1's N-terminal to form trimeric subunits and multimers with other SP-A1 and SP-A2 molecules. The presence of a valine instead of an alanine at this SNP locus may allow for effective binding of the N-terminal of SP-A1 to other SP-A1 and SP-A2 N-terminals in order to form the subunits and multimers necessary for efficient binding and clearance of bacteria/viruses in the middle ear and Eustachian tube. More efficient destruction and clearance of such pathogens would therefore decrease the host's susceptibility for developing RAOM/OME. In addition, the

Chapter Four: Discussion

117

haplotype 6A2 presented the nucleotide adenine (minor allele) instead of a guanine (major allele) at SP-A1 codon 133. Even though a SNP at this locus results in a synonymous amino acid change (threonine to threonine), the presence of a guanine was shown to be associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME in this study. However, none of these speculations are confirmed by appropriate research and the effect of haplotype 6A2 on the functionality of SP-A1 remains unknown. Haplotype 1A2 (CGCC) was found to be under-represented in the RAOM/OME population of mainly European-Caucasian individuals (P = 0.0133). This finding is suggestive of a protective effect against ROAM/OME in individuals with the haplotype 1A2. At amino acid position 223, haplotype 1A2 contains a glutamine (major allele) instead of a lysine (minor allele) which was found earlier to be over-represented in this study's RAOM/OME population and, therefore, associated with an increased risk of RAOM/OME. Nonetheless, no scientific evidence is available regarding the influence of haplotype 1A2 on SP-A2's ability to bind to pathogens and facilitate their destruction/clearance. Furthermore, no association between any of the four SP-D haplotypes and decreased risk of RAOM/OME was found in the case population studied.

New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island RAOM/OME Population

In concordance with their significantly greater prevalence of RAOM/OME and subsequent hearing loss (National Audiology Centre, 2003; Paterson et al., 2006), it was expected that a

Chapter Four: Discussion

118

population of New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals would exhibit more RAOM/OME associated alleles and haplotypes than the mainly European-Caucasian population. A subset of New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals diagnosed with RAOM/OME were analyzed for significant differences in SP-A1,

SP-A2, and/or SP-D alleles and haplotypes in comparison to the
control population. The most common SP-A1 haplotypes in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals with RAOM/OME were 6A2, 6A3, CGAAC, 6A11, and 6A4. Most frequent SP-A2 haplotypes were 1A0, 1A1, 1A5, 1A2, and 1A in decreasing order. As with the European-Caucasian RAOM/OME population and the control population, SP-D haplotypes TA, TG, and CG made up approximately 98% of the SP-D haplotypes detected in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island RAOM/OME population.

frequencies in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island population of individuals diagnosed with RAOM/OME determined that there were six alleles associated with increased risk of the diseases (P < 0.05). A leucine (major allele) and tryptophan (minor allele) at codons 50 and 219 of SP-A1, respectively, were individually found to be associated with an increased risk of RAOM/OME (SPA1-50C, P = 3.22 x10-5; SPA1-219T, P = 3.00 x10-4). Both of these alleles were previously associated by Selman and colleagues (2003)

Chapter Four: Discussion

119

with increased predisposition to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive lung disorder, characterized by sequential acute lung epithelial injuries and fibrosis (SPA1-50C: 94.4 vs 74.8, OR = 6.68, 95% CI = 1.87 ­ 23.86, P = <0.01; SPA1-219T: 7.8 vs. 22.2, OR = 3.13, 95% CI = 1.18 ­ 8.32, P = 0.02). The presence of a tryptophan at SP-A1 codon 219 was predicted by PolyPhen to be `damaging' to SP-A1's structure and function. No other allele in SP-A1, SP-A2, or SP-D was predicted to have a deleterious effect on the corresponding protein's structural and functional attributes. Selman et al. (2003) demonstrated that SP-A1 with a tryptophan at codon 219 was more susceptible to oxidation than its arginine-containing counterparts, and selfaggregated to a higher level as a consequence. In the context of RAOM/OME, it is possible that the increased levels of reactive oxygen species (i.e. nitric oxide) produced by phagocytes in response to pathogen infection may lead to increased oxidation of SP-A and SP-D in the middle ear, ultimately resulting in a reduction in their ability to bind to and clear bacteria and/or viruses. Furthermore, particular amino acid substitutions may render the proteins either more or less susceptible to free radical damage. On the no other hand, despite these hypothetical evidence is explanations, substantiating experimental

available that addresses the functional effect of the presence of a tryptophan at SP-A1 codon 219. The presence of a proline (major allele), serine (minor allele), and lysine (minor allele) at SP-A2 codons 91, 140, and 223, respectively, were also individually associated with an increased risk of RAOM/OME (SPA2-91C, P = 0.0018; SPA2-140T, P = 3.00 x10-4; SPA2-223A, P = 0.0042). Currently, there have been no

Chapter Four: Discussion

120

other association studies that have identified a proline and a serine at SP-A2 codons 91 and 140 as disease markers. As previously discussed, a proline at SP-A2 codon 91 may prevent formation of some secondary structures essential for SPA2 to form oligomers, bind to pathogens, and interact with other immune-related cells/molecules. However, no research has been conducted to assess the structural and functional consequences of this substitution. The SNP at SP-A2 codon 140 results in a synonymous amino acid change which does not affect the gene product, therefore it was not predicted that this locus would be associated with RAOM/OME. Having a thymidine (minor allele) at this SNP locus instead of a cytosine (major allele), may result in reduced CpG methylation and ensuing enhanced gene expression. If this was the case, it would be expected that increased transcription and translation of SP-A2 would, in fact, improve host susceptibility to RAOM/OME as enhanced bacterial/viral clearance would be possible. However, it is possible that over-production of SP-A2 occurs as a result of hypomethylation, leading to prolonged inflammation and related damage in the middle ear and Eustachian tube. Further work in this area is needed to assess the consequences (if any), a thymidine at SP-A2 codon 140 will cause the protein. Pettigrew et al. (2006) could not obtain reproducible results for the C/T polymorphism at SPA2-140, using the allele-specific primers previously published (Pantelidis et al., 2003). The identical allele-specific primers for SPA2-140 were employed in the present study but no such difficulty was encountered. Perhaps the additional genotyping success achieved was due to

Chapter Four: Discussion

121

the touchdown thermocycling protocol utilized. There was no evidence given to suggest that Pettigrew

et

al.

(2006)

investigated the appropriate annealing temperature needed for the SPA2-140 primers, however in the present study, the optimal annealing temperatures for the real-time PCR were determined by gradient PCR in order to increase specificity for amplification and subsequently reduce mispriming.

Lastly, in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island population, an increased risk of RAOM/OME was associated with the presence of an alanine (minor allele) at amino acid position 160 of SP-D (P = 0.0292). Amino acid position 160 is located within the collagenous domain of SP-D, a region essential for binding to collectin receptors and for complement activation via the lectin pathway (Eda et al., 1996; Erdei and Reid, 1989; Ikeda et al., 1987). Perhaps the presence of an alanine at this position in the collagenous domain results in impaired binding to collectin receptors, reduced complement activation, and decreased clearance of pathogens causing RAOM/OME. Changes in the collagenous domain of mannose binding lectin have been shown to contribute to immunodeficiencies in affected individuals (Summerfield et al., 1995), but similar research has not been conducted with SP-D.

allele), leucine (major allele), proline (minor allele), threonine (minor allele) and a tryptophan (minor allele) at SP-A1 codons 19, 50, 62, 133, and 219. Haplotype 6A10 encodes an alanine (major allele), leucine (major allele), proline (major allele), threonine (minor allele), and an arginine at the five SP-A1 codons. Both haplotypes 6A8 and 6A10 encode a leucine at SP-A1 codon 50, which was already determined to be associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island population. In addition, haplotype 6A8 also encodes a tryptophan at SP-A1 codon 219, another allele linked with increased RAOM/OME susceptibility in this study's New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island population. In the European-Caucasian RAOM/OME population, haplotypes 1A3 (AGTA) and 1A10 (CCTA) were linked to increased risk of RAOM/OME. Haplotype 1A3 contains an asparagine (major allele), alanine (minor allele), serine (minor allele), and a lysine (minor allele) at SP-A2 codons 9, 91, 140, and 223. Haplotype 1A10 encodes a threonine (minor allele), proline (major allele), serine (minor allele), and a lysine (minor allele), at the four SPA2 loci. Haplotypes 1A3 and 1A10 were also found to have the same associations in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island population, indicating that they also are protective against RAOM/OME regardless of an individual's ethnicity (1A3, P = 0.0029; 1A10, P = 7.00 x10-4). Haplotype 1A3 encodes a serine and a lysine at codons 140 and 223, two alleles which were individually shown to be associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals. Haplotype 1A10 also contains a serine and lysine at codons 140 and 223, as well as a proline at codon 91. A proline at this amino acid position was also found earlier to be

Haplotype 6A2 was identified as a protective haplotype against RAOM/OME (P = 8.00 x10-5), similar to the European-Caucasian case population, the findings of Rämet et al. (2001), and Pettigrew et al. (2006). SP-A2 haplotypes 1A0 and 1A2 were both found to be protective against susceptibility to RAOM/OME in New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals (1A0, P = 0.0038; 1A2, P = 0.0377). Similar results were found in the European-Caucasian case population, except the population frequency difference of haplotype 1A0 in the total case population compared to the control population exhibited in borderline order to significance. Without further experimentation

replicate the results, it cannot be determined whether 1A0 is, in fact, a protective haplotype in European-Caucasian individuals as well as in New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals. In light of previous research, which documented that haplotype 1A0 was protective in other Caucasian populations (Pettigrew et al., 2006; Rämet et al., 2001), it is likely that the same applies for the total case population in the present study. Additional studies

with larger population sizes need to be undertaken in order to confirm or challenge these results.

SP-D haplotype TA was observed to be protective against host
susceptibility to RAOM/OME in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals (P = 0.0192). It is possible that the association of this haplotype is due to the presence of an alanine at SP-D codon 160, which was previously shown to be over-represented in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island population in comparison to the control population. The population containing New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals diagnosed with RAOM/OME exhibited an underrepresentation of the SPA1/SPA2/SPD haplotype 6A2-1A0-TA. These three haplotypes were found to be protective against susceptibility to RAOM/OME individually and were concurrent with each other in over 10% of the individuals. The finding that a New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island population displays a significant reduction in the RAOM/OME protecting haplotype 6A21A0-TA suggests that such individuals are genetically more susceptible counterparts. to RAOM/OME than their European-Caucasian

125

meningococcal disease were genotyped for the eleven SNP loci in

SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D and allele/haplotype frequencies were
compared to the control population to identify any significant differences. Haploview analysis uncovered an association between an alanine at codon 160 of SP-D and meningococcal disease. The presence of an adenine instead of a guanine at SPD-160 was found to be over-represented in the meningococcal population (P = 0.0437). No association between a lysine at SP-A2 codon 223 and meningococcal disease was found. As previously discussed, the non-synonymous substitution of a threonine for an alanine at codon 160 of SP-D may alter SP-D collagenous domain's ability to participate in immune-related pathways, which in turn could result in increased host susceptibility to infection by Neisseria meningitidis. However, to date no research has investigated this suggestion. individuals diagnosed with meningococcal Only three were disease

genotyped for the eleven SNPs in SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D in this study; thus, it is possible that findings from such a small population may not be valid. Further research with a larger sample size would either validate or challenge the results from this study and that of Jack et al. (2006).

4.6

Copy Number Variants of SP-A1 and SP-A2

In addition to the genomic variation seen between individuals due to SNPs, it has recently been ascertained that the human genome is adundant in copy number variations (CNVs) of DNA segments often ranging from kilobases to megabases in length

Chapter Four: Discussion

126

(Redon et al., 2006). Redon and colleagues (2006) defined a CNV as a genomic region equal or greater than 1 kb in length and present in variable copy numbers, compared to a reference genome. They conducted a global genome-wide scan for CNVs in 270 individuals representing four populations with different ancestry. Nearly 1,500 CNVs were identified across the 270 samples covering approximately 12% of the human genome, with the mean total CNV length per genome estimated at more than 20 Mbp. These figures suggested that the average amount of genomic variation between any two randomly selected individuals was 5 ­ 10 times greater than previously estimated by SNP studies (Shianna and Willard, 2006). If these CNVs occur within a gene or its regulatory region, duplications or deletions could alter the levels of mRNA produced for that gene, which would consequently result in increased or reduced levels of protein translated. In the context of SP-A1, SP-

A2, and SP-D any CNVs within these genes could influence gene
expression, phenotypic variation, and/or gene dosage and could increase/decrease host susceptibility to related diseases e.g. RAOM and/or OME. Gonzalez and co-workers (2005) investigated inter-individual and inter-population variations in the copy number of a segmental encodes duplication a containing the gene

CCL3L1, which

suppressive chemokine and ligand for the HIV co-receptor CCR5. They found that individuals with a CCL3L1 copy number lower than the population average exhibited a significantly higher susceptibility to HIV and/or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The researchers concluded that variations in the quantity of immune-related genes like that seen in CCL3L1,

Chapter Four: Discussion

127

may contribute to a genetic susceptibility or resistance to particular infectious diseases. In the latest human genome reference sequence (Ensemble human, release 40), two identical copies of both SP-A1 and SP-

A2 were evident, approximately 300 kb apart, while only one
copy of SP-D was apparent. Duplication of SP-A1 and SP-A2 indicates that CNV is present in the genes' region. If this was the case it would suggest that differences in the copy numbers of

SP-A1 and SP-A2 would result in gene dosage variations. Lower
(or higher) amounts of the proteins in the middle ear may result in reduced (or enhanced) bacterial/viral clearance; thus any individual could have a genetically determined level of susceptibility to RAOM and/or OME. However, there is no evidence to support this hypothesis. Joanna Floros, Professor of Cellular and Molecular Physiology at the Pennsylvania State University, USA, examined the duplicated sequences of SP-A1 and SP-A2 and also found them to be identical (personal communication, 2006). For example, there was only one nucleotide difference between the two SP-A1 sequences of approximately 3.2 kb. However, Floros considered that it was unlikely that each SP-A1 and SP-A2 was duplicated, and given that the sequence of the two SP-A genes is so similar, any computer matching analysis could potentially produce flawed results.

Study Limitations

4.7.1

Confounding Factors

It has been frequently noted that very few published findings of significant associations between alleles and disease can be replicated indisputably (Colhoun

et

al.,

2003).

Statistical

evidence that indicates an association between an allele and a particular disease phenotype could arise from three situations (Cordon and Palmer, 2003): 1. Stochastic variation in allele frequencies present in the populations. 2. Associated allele may be in linkage disequilibrium with a causative allele located nearby. 3. Associated allele may have a functional and direct effect on the corresponding gene product. Linkage disequilibrium in an individual's genome depends heavily on the population's history and the genetic characteristics of the population's founding individuals (Hirschorn et al., 2002). For example, in a population with a relatively recent common ancestor such as New Zealand Maori and Pacific Islanders, fewer recombination events would have occurred to separate the SP-

A1, SP-A2, and SP-D alleles. Therefore, certain haplotypes will
often be inherited together throughout the population. On the other hand, a European-Caucasian population with a relatively older common ancestor would have been subjected to more recombination events, possibly resulting in disrupted linkage disequilibrium and reduced haplotype inheritance. Thus, if a specific allele is in linkage disequilibrium with a nearby

Chapter Four: Discussion

129

RAOM/OME-associated allele in one population (e.g. Maori and Pacific Island) but not another (e.g. European-Caucasian), then a false positive association between that allele and RAOM/OME could possibly have occurred. It is possible that higher linkage disequilibrium in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island population may have resulted in the incidence of more SP-A1,

SP-A2, and SP-D alleles and haplotypes appearing to be
implicated with RAOM/OME in this study. Another confounding factor that has been noted to affect the validity of genetic association studies is population stratification. Population stratification occurs when the case and control groups of a genetic association study are drawn from two or more ethnic groups, and one of these groups has higher disease prevalence than the others (Hirschorn et al., 2002). Stratification occurs due to the fact that the high-prevalence group will be overrepresented in the case group, and under-represented in the control group. Therefore, an allele that is found by chance to be more frequent in the high-prevalence group will falsely appear to be associated with the disease in question. In this study, allele and haplotype frequencies in a population containing twenty-two New Zealand Maori or Pacific Island individuals diagnosed with RAOM/OME was compared to a control population consisting of mainly European-Caucasian individuals. It is possible that due to the higher prevalence of RAOM/OME in New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island children, their subsequent over-representation in the case group and under-representation in the control group, that population stratification was present. If this is true then it is also possible that some of the alleles/haplotypes found in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island population to be implicated with RAOM/OME are in fact indicative of stochastic variation in the population.

4.7.2

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

If a particular SNP is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in a population then the observed genotype frequencies should simply be a function of the relative allele frequencies, assuming that migration, mutation, natural selection, and assortative mating are absent (Wigginton et al., 2005). All eleven SP-A1,

SP-A2, and SP-D SNPs were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium in the case, control, and Pacific Island populations, except for the following two exceptions: The SNP at SP-A1 codon 50 exhibited a level of heterozygosity significantly lower in the total case population than expected by the Haploview program based on the raw major and minor allele frequencies (P = 1.00 x10-4). Such a discrepancy indicated that the SNP was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In contrast,

SPA1-50 was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control
population and the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island population. A similar scenario was seen at SP-A2 codon 91 in the control population. The predicted proportion of heterozygotes was significantly higher than that observed (P = 5.64 x10-6), thus the SNP was also not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within that population. However, no significant deviations from HardyWeinberg equilibrium were seen at SPA2-91 in the case population population. Wigginton and associates (2005) suggested that any departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at a particular SNP locus could be due to problems with population structure or genotyping. or the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island

Chapter Four: Discussion

131

Furthermore, if the SNP in question is in the context of a population consisting of affected individuals (i.e. diagnosed with RAOM/OME) then it may suggest an association between the SNP locus and that particular disease. However, no association between SPA1-50 and RAOM/OME was apparent (P > 0.05) in the total case population, even though the locus was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

4.8

Conclusions

In a population of primarily European-Caucasians, two SP-A1 alleles and one SP-A2 allele were found to be associated with increased susceptibility to RAOM/OME. SP-A1 haplotype 6A2 and

SP-A2 haplotype 1A2 were both found to be protective against
RAOM/OME. However, a previously unclassified SP-A1 haplotype CGAGC, and three SP-A2 haplotypes (1A3, 1A9, and 1A10) were shown to be associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME. Significantly different results were observed in a population of New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals diagnosed with RAOM/OME. Twice as many alleles (two SP-A1 alleles, three SP-

A2 alleles, and one SP-D allele) were found to be overrepresented in the affected individuals and therefore associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME. One SP-A1 haplotype (6A2), two SP-A2 haplotypes (1A0 and 1A2), and one SP-D haplotype (TA) were all found to have a protective effect against RAOM/OME. On the other hand, two SP-A1 haplotypes (6A8 and 6A10) and two SP-A2 haplotypes (1A3 and 1A10) were associated with increased susceptibility to RAOM/OME. The SPA1/SPA2/SPD haplotype 6A2-1A0-TA was under-represented in the New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals with RAOM/OME.

Chapter Four: Discussion

132

The observation of additional alleles and haplotypes that were associated with increased risk of RAOM/OME, and the reduced frequency of the protective haplotypes suggests that New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals maybe more susceptible to RAOM/OME than European-Caucasian individuals. However, very little is known about the functional consequences of the various SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D alleles and haplotypes and whether they really do affect the corresponding protein's host defense abilities, thus, it would be naïve to conclude that the findings of this study accurately describe valid explanations for host susceptibility or resistance to RAOM/OME. A single SP-D allele and haplotype (TA) were found to be associated with increased susceptibility to meningococcal disease. However, this finding does not confirm the results of a much larger association study (Jack et al., 2006) and the small sample size employed in the present study may mean that the data are not significant. Despite the apparent significant results of this study there are a number of potential confounding variables that could challenge their validity. It is vital that more research is done to further confirm or deny the relationship of SP-A and SP-D variants with susceptibility/resistance to RAOM/OME.

4.9

Future Research

The findings of this present study are the first to suggest a possible genetic predisposition of New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals to RAOM/OME. In order to confirm or challenge these findings, it would be valuable to replicate the current

Chapter Four: Discussion

133

methodology using two larger separate populations of New Zealand Maori and Pacific Island individuals. This would allow researchers to see if there is any significant difference in the SP-

A1, SP-A2, and SP-D alleles and haplotypes between the two
populations. A large amount of time and effort is needed to research the structural and functional consequences of the SP-A1, SP-A2, and

SP-D allele and haplotypes on the actual proteins themselves,
and whether these affect the proteins' ability to combat bacterial and/or viral infection in the middle ear and Eustachian tube. For example, purified SP-A and SP-D could be isolated from individuals with specific genetic variants, and assayed for bacterial and viral binding efficiency. Novel research investigating the possibility of SP-A1 and SP-A2 copy number variations would also be beneficial to researchers studying SP-A and SP-D influences on a variety of pulmonary pathologies as well as RAOM/OME in the middle ear. It would be interesting to determine whether individuals particularly resistant to RAOM/OME displayed higher copy numbers of SP-A1 and SP-

A2, compared to susceptible individuals. Furthermore, copy
number variations across a range of ethnicities (i.e. EuropeanCaucasian, New Zealand Maori, Pacific Island, and others) would identify any ethnicity-related variations.

Project Purpose Middle ear diseases are among the most common diseases found in infants and children. The genetic influence on an individual's susceptibility of these diseases is currently unknown. Particular proteins found in the lungs, associated with preventing and combating infection, have also been found in the middle ear. These proteins are called Surfactant Proteins. These proteins have been found to bind to many different pathogens often found in middle ear diseases and promote

their destruction. A mutation in these proteins may cause them to be less active or not at all. This study wants to find out if individuals with these mutations are more prone to middle ear diseases. Project Method A small blood sample will be taken by the surgeon during your child's scheduled surgery at Waikato Hospital. This will not result in an increased time in theatre. The sample will be transported to the Molecular Genetics Lab at the University of Waikato, and stored at 4°C until required. Then the DNA from the blood cells will be isolated and analyzed using specialized techniques that will identify the mutations in question. Approximately 100 participants will be involved in this project. All participants will be patients admitted to Waikato Hospital for surgery due to middle ear disease. After analysis, all blood samples and DNA will be kept until safely disposed of in July 2007.

APPENDIX II

SEQUENCING RESULTS

For

each

of

the

eleven

SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D SNPs

investigated in this study, the major and minor allele-specific primers amplified the same genomic region during real-time PCR. The following sections describe the sequence of the single amplified region, for each of these SNPs, and their subsequent National Centre of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST searches.
