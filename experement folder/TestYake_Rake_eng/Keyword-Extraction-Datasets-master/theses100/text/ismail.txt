Abstract
Drug delivery technology is currently advancing faster than at any time in biotechnology history. The challenge of drug delivery is to achieve a controlled release of therapeutic agents over an extended period. Controlled release potentially offers significant advantages over conventional dosage forms, by eliminating both under- and overdosing while maintaining a desired range of drug concentrations. An existing drug regimen for induced calving produces a declining blood profile that does not mimic the naturally occurring, gradually increasing, cortisol blood level around parturition effectively, causing animal health issues. Likewise, while the existing progesterone controlled release systems for oestrous control successfully synchronise oestrus, it is however, associated with reduced fertility and as such other drugs have to be administered to improve the fertility during oestrus. Therefore, there is a need for a drug delivery system that is capable of delivering multiple drugs at various times and patterns. This research aimed to investigate, characterize, identify steroids with high absorption rates through vaginal mucosa and evaluate the potential of an electronic drug delivery system for the delivery of steroids for either the control of the bovine oestrous cycle or induced calving. In order to identify steroids with high absorption rates across the vaginal mucosa, an in vitro permeation method was developed to screen selected steroids for their ability to permeate artificial and biological membranes. The steroids were preformulated to enhance their solubility and permeation through these membranes. Analytical UV and HPLC assays to characterise the pure and formulated steroidal compounds were also developed and validated. An assessment of an intravaginal Electronically Modulated Intravaginal Device (EMID) for the control of the bovine oestrous cycle or induced calving was carried out. Five different release assessment methods were investigated and critically evaluated in order to identify the most appropriate release assessment method for the EMID. These were: 1) the Drug Dissolution Test, 2) a weight loss method, 3) the dispensed weight method, 4) the determination of piston travel distance method, and 5) the rod expulsion from the EMID method. The methods investigated were critically evaluated in ii

terms of ease of use and automation, reproducibility and cost/time savings. Optimisation of various components and construction materials of the EMID were also investigated. Animal trials were carried out using the original EMID (manufactured from polypropylene polymer) and modified inserts (manufactured from high density polyethylene polymer) to determine their retention rate in the animals. Accelerated stability testing of progesterone in suspension, oestradiol17 tablets, cloprostenol as a powder blend and the driving mechanism of the EMID were examined. The flux of the steroids was evaluated through poly--caprolactone and excised cow mucosa membranes using side-by-side permeation cells. Results indicated that progesterone followed by dexamethasone acetate and dexamethasone valerate showed higher permeability values through vaginal mucosa compared to dexamethasone or its other analogues. The weight loss method of the EMID proved to be an easy and appropriate method to measure the release rate from the EMID. A high density polyethylene polymer was identified as the most ideal body material for the insert compared to polypropylene body. Also double O-ring silicone, Elastollan WYO 1388-5 and solid silicone pistons were found to be amongst the best pistons tested and all performed well compared to other piston materials. There was a low retention rate with either the original EMID or the modified inserts. Further modification of retention wings of the EMID did not improve the retention rate, but a good blood profile response was obtained from cows treated with the complete EMID containing formulated progesterone. The formulations and driving mechanism were found to be stable under the tested conditions. Therefore, the EMID has potential for commercial application of induced calving or oestrous control per vaginum administration, reliant on improvement of its retention mechanism.

Introduction to induced calving and oestrous control

Induced calving and oestrous control are farm management tools used to achieve the following: 1) to make cows calve prematurely, 2) to bring a large number of animals into oestrus at a predetermined time, 3) to reduce the calving period of the herd to the shortest period possible, and 4) to achieve high conception rates at the end of the mating period (Nation, 1997; Holmes & Garcia, 1999; Compton, 2005a). In New Zealand, seasonal calving is a prevailing zootechnical strategy used to synchronise the time of calving with the increase in pasture growth and the decrease in feed demand at the drying-off season with the reduction in pasture growth. Oestrous synchronisation is used to induce oestrus in a large proportion of a herd within a short period in order to eliminate the need of the oestrus detection, a process that is normally difficult and time consuming (Jemmeson, 2000). Both induced calving and oestrous synchronisation involve administering hormones to control either the pregnancy or reproductive cycle of cattle. In the case of induced calving, hormones are administered using intramuscular injections whereas for oestrus synchronisation, hormones can be administered either by intramuscular injections or through the use of intravaginal devices or subcutaneous implants. The existing drug delivery systems used for induced calving lead to health issues for the animals such as high mortality rates of the newborn calf and the maternal cow endometrial disease due to retained foetal membranes (Stevens et al., 2000). Drug delivery systems for oestrous synchronisation are designed to deliver a single drug at one time, however, for oestrous synchronisation to be effective, several drugs must be administered to improve fertility. A review of the New Zealand dairy farming industry with respect to current induced calving and oestrous synchronisation protocols are elaborated herein.

1.1

The New Zealand dairy farming industry

The majority of New Zealand dairy cows calve once a year, in a concentrated pattern in late winter-early spring (Nation, 1997; Holmes & Garcia, 1999). This seasonal calving allows the increase in the herd's feeding requirements after 1

Chapter One

calving to coincide with the increase in pasture growth during springtime. At this time, the cows need extra energy to cope with the commencement of lactation and the resumption of the reproductive cycle. The lactation period usually lasts about 300 days in a year to allow for a dry period of at least 60 days before next calving (Holmes & Garcia, 1999). However, there are a significant number of cows that calve later than the desired calving time, and conceive late in the breeding season, thereby making it difficult to bring these cows forward to the optimal calving season (Welch, 1973; Welch et al., 1979; Compton, 2005b). Late calving cows are more likely to be dried off while they are still milking heavily and, therefore, would have a shorter lactation period and result in a poorer return for the farmer. In order to control the uneven calving time among the cows in the same herd and to make the lactation period coincide with the availability of pasture, production induced calving was introduced into New Zealand in 1973.

1.2

Induced calving

The normal gestation period of dairy cattle ranges between 278 and 290 days (Allen et al., 1976). However, this period may be shortened by terminating the pregnancy through drug intervention. Therefore, the incidence of late calving cows can be reduced by prematurely induced calving (Welch et al., 1979). These cows can then be brought back in synchronisation with the rest of herd to the normal conception date of the following season. This practice enables seasonal calving patterns to be maintained among dairy herds and gives the late calving cows the opportunity to become pregnant in time to calve naturally at an optimal time. Other possible reasons for induced calving include: 1) grouping calving at a precise time to ensure adequate care and shelter, 2) extending the mating season, 3) reducing calf size and incidence of dystocia (difficult labour) and 4) terminating undesired pregnancy for medical reasons (Allen at al., 1976; Gordon, 1996).

1.2.1

Practical aspects of induced calving

Parturition has been induced using exogenous pharmacological agents while mimicking the hormonal changes during the last few days of cow pregnancy (Adams, 1969). Administration of synthetic corticosteroids to the pregnant cow 2

Chapter One

results in expulsion of the foetus from as early as two months before the end of the pregnancy. A similar situation to natural parturition can be seen if dexamethasone is injected into pregnant cows to induce parturition (Kindahl et al., 2004). Corticosteroids alone or in combination with prostaglandins are also used for the induction calving (Refsdal, 2000). For instance, parturition can be induced reliably in a cow by administration of a single glucocorticoid (e.g., dexamethasone) treatment of the animals after about day 255 and, less reliably, as early as day 235 of gestation (Gordon, 1996). Historically, corticosteroids have been used systematically in over 80% of New Zealand dairy herds to control the birth, to induce premature parturition during the third trimester of pregnancy, and to condense calving patterns into periods of 6-12 weeks (Macmillan, 2002). Corticosteroid preparations used to induce premature calving are divided into two categories depending on the time they take to induce calving, i.e., short-acting and long-acting (McGowan et al., 1975). The short-acting drugs (i.e., dexamethasone and flumethasone) induce parturition within two to three days after administration, but have two major disadvantages: firstly the number of animals which respond to the treatment varies markedly from herd to herd, secondly the animals that do respond have a high incidence of retained placenta. The longer acting drugs (e.g., dexamethasone trimethylacetate) are more widely used and are usually insoluble forms of the short acting drugs (McGowan et al., 1975). They induce calving approximately 15 days after injection. Some reports have suggested that the problem of undesired side effects such as retained placenta are worse with shortacting formulations (Peters & Poole, 1992). When it is desirable that calving should be induced in cows within the last two or three weeks of gestation, a single injection of a number of short-acting preparations (corticosteroids administered as a free alcohol or soluble ester) of dexamethasone and flumethasone have shown to produce reliable and predictable results (Gordon, 1996). Calving induction and the use of corticosteroids (e.g., long- and short-acting corticosteroids) or/and cloprostenol (prostaglandin analogue) to induce parturition is well documented in the literature (Adams, 1969; Agrawal et al., 1993; Allen & Herring, 1976; Barth et al., 1978; Beardsley et al., 1976; Davis et al., 1979; Evans & Wagner, 1976; Fairclough et al., 1975; Fairclough et al., 1981b; Fulkerson & 3

Induction of parturition by injections of prostaglandin F2 (PGF) alone or its analogue has been suggested to be non-physiological as the foetal cortisol levels obtained from the induced calving cows were not ideal to mimic the blood profiles obtained from the naturally calving cows (McGowan et al., 1975; Königsson, 2001).

1.2.2

Effect of induced calving on milk production

Induced calving can have both direct and indirect effects on subsequent milk production. The direct effect can be seen by comparing the difference in subsequent milk production between induced and non-induced cows that calve at the same time. The indirect effect is the difference in subsequent milk production due to altered calving dates (Morton & Butler, 1995a). While studies found induced calving increased milk production by increasing the number of days in milk, the induced cows produced 9% less than cows that calved naturally on the same day (Morton & Butler, 1995a).

1.2.3

Effect of induced calving on reproductive performance

One of the biggest challenges that New Zealand dairy farmers face is to improve the reproductive performance of their herds (Compton, 2005a). Induced calving minimises the adverse effects of declining reproductive performance in dairy herds on the sustainability of seasonally concentrated calving (Macmillan, 2002). Results of induced calving on cows reproductive performance found no effects of induced calving on 3-week submission rates (Morton, 2000). In contrast, results from Morton & Butler, (1995b) and McDougall, (2001) indicate an 8.3% 4

Chapter One

reduction in the induced cows' 28-day pregnancy rate. The induced late calving cows however, got back into calf much sooner after calving than their earlier calving herd mates (Stevens et al., 2000). This means that the difference in calving dates between induced and late calving cows is shorter in the subsequent season.

1.2.4

Animal welfare issues arising from induced calving

Induced calving has now become an animal welfare issue due to high calf mortality rates, the stress it places on the cow and associated animal health problems (Stevens et al., 2000). For instance, the problem of retained foetal membranes (RFM) is associated with induced calving. Table 1.1 presents the effects of calving induction on RFM, stage of pregnancy and the formulation used. The incidence of clinical disease and mortality of induced cows were high relative to their non-induced herd mates (Morton & Butler, 1995c). The corticosteroids used for induction, suppress the immune system of the cow and may reduce its ability to combat disease. Additionally, corticosteroids may cause high mortality rates in induced calves compared with naturally born calves (75% versus 7%, respectively) (Morton & Butler, 1995d). Calf mortality rates vary considerably depending on the timing of induction and the drug regimen used.

Other dexamethasone applications and its misuses in livestock animals

Although dexamethasone is frequently used for the induction of parturition, it is also used in cattle either alone or in combination with antibiotics for the treatment of inflammatory diseases (Toutain et al., 1982; Calvarese et al., 1994). In addition, dexamethasone is the most abused corticosteroid (De Wash et al., 1998). Dexamethasone is used illegally as a growth promoter and has been administered to cattle through livestock food or by injection, in order to achieve mass gains. 6

Chapter One

Similarly, corticosteroids such as betamethasone or its esters have been detected in injection sites. This is unfortunate because the consumption of meat contaminated with injection sites can be a considerable threat to human health. Public opinion rejects the use of growth promoter substances such as corticosteroids in animal fattening (Antignac et al., 2001). Consequently, analytical techniques have been developed, in order to control their illegal use as growth promoters in meat producing animals and to insure food safety. The use of growth promoters has never been allowed in Europe and maximal residue levels have only been established for dexamethasone, which are 0.75 ng/mL in liver, 0.5 ng/mL in muscle and 0.3 ng/mL in milk.

1.2.4.2

Dexamethasone residue in milk and plasma

The levels of dexamethasone in the milk of lactating cows shows the same profiles as the levels in plasma, but the concentration of dexamethasone in milk decreases more rapidly compared to the plasma concentrations because of the shorter half-life of dexamethasone in milk compared to the plasma (Dilova et al., 1999). Dilova et al. (1999) showed that the clearance of dexamethasone from the milk was 5 days. In another study, the concentration of dexamethasone in both milk and plasma of cows treated with 25 mg dexamethasone trimethyl acetate containing radiolabelled molecules showed similar profiles (Fairclough et al., 1981a). The concentration of dexamethasone in both milk and plasma were still detectable at around 0.05 ng/mL, 30 days post injection. Another study showed that dexamethasone traces were still detectable from plasma and affected cortisol levels of the treated cows up to 52 days post injection (Toutain et al., 1982). Even though the drug concentrations were below the maximal residue levels permitted, there was still some concern relating to the residue risk of some long acting corticosteroids. Consequently, the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) defined meat and milk-withholding periods, 35 and 12 days, respectively, where there has been the use of long acting corticosteroids (NZFSA, 2006). Finally, social or marketing pressures have limited the use of calving induction, which is now discouraged on animal welfare grounds and has possible consequences for the marketing of New Zealand dairy 7

Chapter One

products (Macmillan, 2002). This reflects that the modern induced calving does not control the drug residue of long-acting corticosteroids after calving, and consequently, there are animal health concerns due to the undesired side effects arising from the treatment. Corticosteroid release needs to be controlled during and after treatment in order to maintain the desired drug blood responses to mimic naturally occurring profiles around parturition. Safer induced calving in which the prevailing undesired side effects are reduced to minimum is yet to be developed. As discussed earlier, the induced calving involves termination of pregnancy and, therefore, a brief discussion of recent advances in the physiology and endocrinology of bovine pregnancy and parturition is further discussed in the following sections.

1.2.5

Introduction to endocrinology of cattle reproduction

After reaching the age of puberty, cows are either cycling, pregnant or recovering from pregnancy to recycle again. Several hormones produced by the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the uterus, control cattle reproduction (Gordon, 1996). The hypothalamus, pituitary gland and ovary coordinate the reproductive cycle by secreting hormones directly into the blood. The hypothalamus secretes Gonadotrophic Releasing Hormone (GnRH), which in turn stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete two gonadotrophic hormones (Follicle Stimulating Hormone, FSH and Luiteinizing Hormone, LH). LH and FSH control ovarian functions. FSH initiates maturation of ovarian follicles while LH induces ovulation and luteinization of corpus luteum (CL) cells known as granulosa and thecal cells. At the ovaries, the follicles produce oestrogens (primarily oestradiol17) and CL produces progesterone. Both oestradiol-17 and progesterone regulate the reproductive cycle through a series of feed back mechanisms acting on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The uterus produces PGF which causes luteolysis at the end of the oestrous cycle or pregnancy (Kindahl et al., 2004; Goff, 2004). The luteolysis process can be prevented by production of antiluteolytic signals, such as interferon factors produced in the presence of the embryo (Mann et al., 1998; Ivell et al., 2000). The interferon factors prevent PGF release from the endometrial epithelial cells, therefore CL function is maintained and progesterone is released during the pregnancy. 8

1.2.5.1

Physiology and endocrinology of bovine pregnancy and parturition

Steroidal hormones associated with cow pregnancy are mainly progesterone and oestrogens (Kindahl et al., 2002). The progesterone level, which is used to indicate the stage of a cow's reproductive cycle, is near zero during oestrus. When a cow conceives, the progesterone levels rise and remain high for the rest of the gestation period preventing further reproductive cycles occurring during pregnancy (Kindahl et al., 2002; Peters & Lamming, 1983). If conception does not happen, the progesterone level increase, reaches a peak level, and then declines to near zero as the cow returns to oestrus once again. Progesterone plays the dominant role in the maintenance of pregnancy. Progesterone originates from the CL and, later on in pregnancy, is supplemented by further progesterone from the placenta and maternal adrenal glands (Kindahl et al., 2004). It is a known fact that the bovine adrenal glands contribute to progesterone production and are capable of maintaining pregnancy following an ovariectomy at 215 days of gestation (Wendorf et al., 1983). The concentration of oestrogens in bovine blood plasma remain low during the early period of pregnancy and increase gradually throughout mid- to late gestation (Hirako et al., 2003). Oestrogens, which are mainly produced from the placenta and ovaries in the maternal cow during gestation, start to increase between days 70 and 265 of pregnancy (Kindahl et al., 2004). Oestrogens play an essential role in the maintenance of pregnancy and the initiation of parturition. Oestrogens have several derivatives and the major biologically active compounds are oestradiol-17, oestrone and oestriol. Oestrone sulphate, oestrone in its conjugated form, is the major oestrogen that occurs in the pregnant cow. Oestrone sulphate blood level begins to increase around day 50 of pregnancy and gradually increases until day 80 (Hirako et al., 2003). However, oestradiol-17 and oestrone blood levels remain low until day 80. Oestrone sulphate levels are monitored during pregnancy and foetal wellbeing (Kindahl et al., 2004).

1.2.5.1.1

Hormonal blood profiles of the foetus and maternal cow at late pregnancy and around parturition

Maintenance of pregnancy in the cow is dependent upon the balance of several hormones maintained by interactions between the cow, the placenta and the foetus (Kindahl et al., 2002). At late pregnancy and around parturition, the decreased levels of progesterone prior to the time of parturition and the increased levels of oestradiol-17 and PGF on the day of parturition appear to be crucial (Kornmatitsuk et al., 2002). A gradual reduction of progesterone concentration is seen in the last 2-3 days prior to parturition followed by an even more rapid decline in progesterone until delivery, a process known as pre-partial luteolysis (Fairclough et al., 1981b). PGF plasma levels increase in late pregnancy and the highest levels are reached during parturition (Königsson, 2001). Hypothetical profiles of the foetal and maternal hormonal changes around calving period of cattle are shown in Figure 1.1. Initially, the foetal cortisol levels start to rise significantly at less than four days before parturition (Fairclough et al., 1981b). The cortisol rise continues in the next two days and then reaches a maximum level the day before parturition. PGF levels on the other hand start to rise only two days before parturition, and the progesterone level starts to drop dramatically just several hours before parturition and the oestrogen levels continue to rise until on the day of parturition (Figure 1.1).

1.2.5.1.2

Mechanism of naturally occurring parturition

Parturition is a natural event that involves stress and pain for the cow (Hydbring et al., 1999). Cortisol is a naturally occurring stress hormone that is produced by the adrenal gland and released during stress and pain (Kindahl et al., 2004). It is generally accepted that the signal for the initiation of parturition originates in the foetus and not the maternal cow (Taverne et al., 2002). A functionally intact foetal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) dictates the initiation of spontaneous parturition (Young et al., 1996). The mechanism of this trigger is not well understood, but it might be due to stress caused by the foetus reaching its critical size and the lack of space in the uterus. This stress exerts considerable pressure on the foetal hypothalamus to release corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH). CRH and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) together with cortisol are involved in the initiation of parturition in the foetus (Kindahl et al., 2004). ACTH is secreted from the anterior pituitary in response to CRH from the hypothalamus. ACTH stimulates secretion of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. A typical diagram representing a hypothesis for the mechanism of initiation of parturition in the cow is shown in Figure 1.2. The release of cortisol induces the 17-hydroxylase enzyme in the placenta to start the conversion of progesterone to oestrogen (Kindahl et al., 2004). Therefore, the level of progesterone falls and oestrogen increases in the blood. Cortisol also regulates PGF synthesis (Kindahl et al., 2004) such that cortisol induces enzymes, which promote PGF synthesis (Goff, 2004).

Chapter One

In the meantime, the reproductive organs of a pregnant cow undergo discrete changes during gestation. The vulva enlarges, becoming noticeable around the seventh month of gestation. The cervix remains tightly closed and is sealed by a mucus plug. Relaxation of the pelvic ligaments occurs gradually during gestation and becomes more noticeable with approaching parturition (Gordon, 1996). Relaxin, together with oestrogen compounds, soften the cervix, opens the birth canal, and stimulates the release of PGF from the endometrium (Kindahl et al., 2004). Softening of the cervix is due to changes in collagen fibres. These changes lead to loss of the mucus plug followed by dilation and opening of the cervix as well as the stretching of the vagina, which in turn causes neural impulses to the brain through ascending pathways and stimulates the secretion of oxytocin from the pituitary gland, causing the uterine smooth muscles to contract. This makes the uterus become more excitable and starts contractions to propel the foetus into the vaginal canal (Kindahl et al., 2004). Therefore, sequential events, some of which are cervical ripening and dilatation, activation of uterine musculature, attainment of the appropriate posture by the foetus, expulsion of the foetus and detachment and expulsion of the placenta, make up the process of natural parturition (Gordon, 1996). The placental detachment process initiates several weeks before parturition and reaches completion prior to the day of parturition (Königsson, 2001). The final detachment occurs along the interface borders between the foetal and the maternal parts of the placenta.

1.2.5.2

Parturition failures

Complex foetal endocrine dysfunction can lead to growth retardation of the foetus (Hafner et al., 1991). For instance, hypoplasia of the anterior pituitary gland and adrenal cortex dysfunction suggest that a failure in the initiation of parturition results from a foetal deficiency of ACTH and cortisol hormone (Figure 1.2). The lack of foetal brain development can cause prolonged pregnancy since the hypothalamus does not release CRH which triggers the release of ACTH from pituitary (Wintour et al., 1996). In addition, surgical disconnection of the pituitary from the hypothalamus (hypophysectomy) prevents parturition (Poore at al., 1999). Furthermore, some studies have found that an ingestion of certain species 12

Chapter One

of teratogenic plants (i.e., Lupinus formosus and Lupinus arbustus) during specific gestational periods harm the unborn calf, which leads to birth defects and the need for cows induction (Panter et al., 1998; Keeler et al., 1976).

1.2.5.3

Drug intervention to prolong or to shorten pregnancy

Pregnancy can be prolonged or shortened through drug intervention. For example, when pregnant cows are given norgestomet, a progesterone analogues, ear implants, the pregnancy was prolonged and within 36-47 hours after the removal of the implants, the expulsive stage of calving will start (Janszen et al., 1990). This is due to progesterone withdrawal, which is a prerequisite for the normal parturition process. On the opposite end of the spectrum, an intrafoetal infusion of dexamethasone can shorten pregnancy and induce premature parturition in cattle at six weeks before full term (Fairclough et al., 1981b). A study showed that dexamethasone infusions are more effective when given to the foetus rather than the maternal cow. Intrafoetal infusion of prostaglandin can also induce premature parturition in sheep and does so by activating the foetus HPA axis (Young et al., 1996). An infusion of ACTH to hypophysectomised foetuses can also induce labour (Figure 1.2). Similarly, an infusion of cortisol to foetus can lead to premature parturition (Ingram et al., 1999). Feeding pine needles to pregnant cows in late gestation causes incidences of premature parturition due to a change of cortisol, progesterone and oestrogens metabolism (Short et al., 1993). In fact, the feeding of pine needles shortened pregnancy by about two weeks and induced a premature normal rise in cortisol and estradiol-17 associated with parturition (Short et al., 1989). Foetal cortisol triggers the parturition process and causes dramatic changes of oestradiol-17, PGF and progesterone levels in the maternal cow. The levels of cortisol and other hormones in both foetus and the maternal cow close to parturition will be elaborated in the following section.

1.2.5.4

Foetal cortisol, oestrone and oestradiol-17 levels during normal calving

Fairclough and others (1975) investigated plasma cortisol concentrations in the foetus and the maternal cow near full term. Foetal cortisol levels increased 13

Chapter One

progressively from around 10 ng/mL, 9 days before term, to a maximum 60-100 ng/mL at parturition. This six to eight fold increase in foetal cortisol concentrations over the last 10 days of pregnancy was also reported in other studies. For instance, McGowan et al. (1975) found that the foetal cortisol levels were less than 10 ng/mL three weeks before normal parturition, then rose to a peak of up to 80 ng/mL on the day of parturition. In another study, it was found that foetal cortisol rose slowly from 5.0 ± 0.7 ng/mL at 20 days to 9.3 ± 3.0 ng/mL at 10 days before term and then progressively increased to a mean of 74 ng/mL (Hunter et al., 1977), whereas, the foetal oestrone and oestradiol-17 concentrations showed little or no change toward term and were both less than 50 pg/mL.

1.2.5.5

Maternal cortisol, oestrone, oestradiol-17 and PGF levels of normal calving

The maternal cortisol levels remained below 20 ng/mL up to the day of parturition (Fairclough et al., 1975; McGowan et al., 1975). The maternal utero-ovarian oestrogen levels rose slowly from 20 to 10 days pre-partum and then increased more rapidly reaching peak levels of 2.9 ± 0.6 ng/mL for oestrone and 1.4 ± 0.3 ng/mL for oestradiol-17, 1 to 4 days before delivery (Hunter et al., 1977). The maternal progesterone concentrations declined towards term and showed a rapid decrease over the last 36-48 hours before calving. This was concomitant with a gradual rise of PGF until the last 24 hours where there was a dramatic increase, reaching peak levels (5.7 ± 0.6 ng/mL) during labour. During normal parturition, cortisol concentrations increase and continue to rise during foetal expulsion, peak until levels are altered when the calf is born. Levels return to preparturition values one day after calving (Hydbring et al., 1999).

1.2.6

Hormonal blood levels associated with induced calving

Kaker et al. (1984) investigated hormonal profile changes between induced and spontaneous calving cows during and after the induction of parturition using dexamethasone with or without the aid of PGF and found: 1) there were no major differences in progesterone, oestradiol, and prostaglandin concentration between 14

Chapter One

the induced and non-induced cows before or after the treatment, 2) treated cows, which retained foetal membranes, had lower progesterone values one to two days before calving compared to their non-induced counterparts, and 3) PGF concentrations steadily increased in the treated cows in contrast to the dramatic increase that occurred in non-induced cows in the last two days of pregnancy. The study concluded that the pre- and post-partum hormonal profiles and fertility were similar in induced and non-induced cows. Perhaps this similarity between the two groups was because the cows were almost close to their normal calving time and, therefore, the induction programme would have no major impact on them. In both spontaneous and induced calving, maternal plasma progesterone levels fall before oestrogen levels rise suggesting that the induced treatment might mimic the physiological mechanisms by which the foetus induces parturition in cattle. However, cortisol, the trigger hormone or the dexamethasone levels, were not monitored in this study. In another study, the effect of the infusion of dexamethasone into foetal calves, which induced premature parturition in six cows (at day 240 of gestation) on the maternal and foetal hormonal changes were investigated (Fairclough et al., 1981b). Three infusion rates of 0.1, 1.0 or 10 mg/day, which induced calving in 12, 9 and 3 days, respectively, were tested. The maternal hormonal changes observed for all cows were similar. Progesterone levels declined and both oestrogen and PGF concentrations increased before parturition. The foetal plasma cortisol levels were reduced by the higher infusion rates (1.0 or 10 mg/day) during the entire infusion. At the lower infusion rate (0.1 mg/day), there was a rise in foetal cortisol concentration from 5 to 60 ng/mL during the last 2-3 days before parturition. This level of cortisol is similar to that found at naturally occurring delivery as previously discussed. Dexamethasone had no effect on the foetal oestrogen levels at the lowest infusion rate, but at the rate of 1.0 mg/day or greater there was a marked rise in the foetal plasma levels of oestrogen. The study also showed that the effect of dexamethasone infusion on hormonal changes was dose dependent (Fairclough et al., 1981b).

1.2.6.1

The pharmacokinetics of dexamethasone in cows

The pharmacokinetics of dexamethasone were studied in four non-lactating dairy cows all of which received dexamethasone and dexamethasone isonicotinate via 15

Chapter One

the intravenous or the intramuscular route (0.1 mg/kg) (Toutain et al., 1982). Following intravenous administration, the half-lives were similar (5.6 and 4.9 hours, respectively) for dexamethasone and dexamethasone isonicotinate. The peak plasma concentrations reached maximum values within one-minute post injection and bioavailability was approximately 75%-80%. The drug was largely distributed in the tissues and only a fraction of the intravenous dose reached the systemic circulation as intact drug (Toutain et al., 1982). The plasma concentrations of both formulations showed a very rapid and high blood response (very sharp initial concentrations can be toxic to the animal subjects) with ranges from 500 to 600 ng/mL, followed by a three phase declining profile. The first and second phases were rapid (0-16 and 16-60 minutes, respectively) whereas the final phase was prolonged and showed the elimination of the drug up to 24 hours later. This study found that the two formulations produced similar results, 1) showing dexamethasone isonicotinate releases dexamethasone as the active compound, and 2) the ester bond hydrolysis was very rapid and complete since the dexamethasone concentration in plasma reached the highest level within one minute. Like wise, following intramuscular administration of dexamethasone or dexamethasone isonicotinate (0.1 mg/kg) in the same number of cows, the half-lives showed no significant difference between the two formulations (6.6 and 6.1 hours). For both formulations the plasma concentrations initially increased, the peak plasma concentrations (ranges between 42 and 44ng/mL) were reached at 3 to 4 hours post injection and bioavailability was approximately 70%. The plasma concentrations reached a plateau level and subsequently the concentrations decreased as observed at the post intravenous injection. Both the intravenous and intramuscular dexamethasone injections showed different plasma profiles. The dexamethasone was available in the blood circulation immediately after the intravenous administration, whereas with the intramuscular administered dexamethasone, absorption took place before the drug was available in the blood circulation. The half-lives of dexamethasone absorption range between 1.5 and 2.0 hours for the two formulations, respectively. The plasma concentration of dexamethasone in cows following the administration of dexamethasone esters showed that plasma dexamethasone concentrations were elevated for 3-4 and 7-8 days following intramuscular injection of soluble short-acting and insoluble long16

Chapter One

acting dexamethasone esters, respectively (Fairclough et al., 1981a). For instance, the plasma concentration of dexamethasone in cows injected intramuscularly with either 20 mg of dexamethasone trimethyl acetate or tributyl derivative reached peak levels of 0.6-1.1 ng/mL of dexamethasone in 2-6 days then declined to undetectable levels (<0.15 ng/mL) 14 days after the injection, whereas the equal dose of dexamethasone sodium phosphate resulted in the plasma concentrations of dexamethasone which increased sharply to maximum levels of 24-70 ng/mL within 2-20 minutes and fell to undetectable levels (<0.15 ng/mL) after 3 days. In the case of dexamethasone tributyl acetate the plasma concentration between the treated cows showed a similar pattern with maximum levels of 0.7-1.1 ng/mL occurring 1-7 days following the injection. In the case of dexamethasone sodium phosphate treatment the plasma concentration between the treated cows showed a considerable variation with a peak value ranging from 22-70 ng/mL. This study demonstrated that the insoluble ester formulations of dexamethasone could lead to a sustained release of dexamethasone into systemic circulation from intramuscular injections. Dexamethasone pharmacokinetics in sheep using two injectable dexamethasone formulations-water suspension of dexamethasone associated with albumin microspheres (AM) and water-alcohol solution of dexamethasone were studied (Dilova et al., 1999). Following intramuscular injection of a water suspension containing dexamethasone-AM (at 1 mg active substances/kg of animal body weight), a plateau of plasma concentration of 23-25 ng/mL was observed within the animal blood levels between 72-120 hours post injection, and then subsequently the concentration decreased. Dexamethasone blood levels showed a gradual decrease until six days post injection. In contrast, the blood plasma concentration of dexamethasone obtained after injection of 1 mg dose/kg of animal body weight containing water or alcohol solution, which reached a short time peak of 55-59 ng/mL at about 3 hours post injection and then concentration decreased drastically and returned to the baseline concentration within several hours. This study demonstrated that a sustained release of dexamethasone for a period of a week could be achieved when dexamethasone is associated with MA.

1.2.6.2

Current dexamethasone delivery systems for inducing calving and its shortfalls

To imitate the natural slow rise of cortisol during parturition, a two-injection schedule has been developed for current induction protocols (Verkerk et al., 1997). The current treatment is based on injection of late pregnant cows with insoluble esters of dexamethasone from which the drug is released over two weeks after the injection and followed by a further boost injection of soluble dexamethasone. The initial priming dose of a long- acting steroid, followed some days later by injection of a short- acting formulation, was developed to produce a reliable and predictable response. Between the two injections the treated cows may or may not respond to the first long acting steroid. The first injection, an intramuscular injection of a long acting depot corticosteroid such as of 21 mg dexamethasone isonicotinate (Voren AP, Boeringer-Ingelheim (NZ) Ltd; I1) initiates the induction process. Cows that have adequate udder development and vulva enlargement after 10-15 days receive a further intramuscular injection, of 20 mg dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Dexadresin V, Pharmaco (NZ) Ltd; I2), which results in parturition typically within 3-4 days. If udder development is not adequate, an additional I1 is administered. During the treatments, all relevant information is recorded, and all cows receiving I2 are examined at 3-5 days postpartum to determine the presence of retained foetal membranes (Verkerk et al., 1997). Presently, limited data exists on dexamethasone pharmacokinetics in plasma due to current calving practices. However, studies demonstrated dexamethasone blood levels followed by the intramuscular injection of insoluble (long-acting) or soluble (short-acting) dexamethasone esters differed from cortisol levels found during natural delivery. For instance, the long-acting preparations produced increase of plasma dexamethasone concentrations in the treated cows within a week following the intramuscular injection then declined to undetectable levels within two weeks after the injection (Fairclough et al., 1981a). The short acting preparations resulted in the plasma concentrations of dexamethasone, which increased sharply to reach maximum levels within a short time and fell to undetectable levels after 3 days. An ideal dexamethasone preparation for induced 18

Chapter One

calving should produce dexamethasone plasma levels that slowly increase, continue to rise around parturition and peak when the calf is born. Finally, the concentration of dexamethasone in plasma should return to preparturition levels after calving. Based on the foregoing studies, dexamethasone formulations need to be frequently administered by injection or infusion in order to maintain the desired hormonal blood levels until calving occurs. In addition, dexamethasone activity depends on the route of administration i.e., intramuscular versus intravenous injection (Toutain et al., 1982) and the type of dexamethasone esters dexamethasone-21 trimethyl acetate versus dexamethasone-21 sodium phosphate used (Fairclough et al., 1981a). Suffices to say that both short and long-acting dexamethasone preparations showed declining profiles and dexamethasone levels were not maintained within a desired range during the treatment. This is the short fall of the current treatment and hence, finding a controlled drug release system to achieve a sustained dexamethasone release during the treatment would be advantageous.

1.2.6.3

Some conceptually developed dexamethasone delivery systems

An injectable biodegradable sustained release formulation was developed when drug compounds were entrapped in cross-linked bovine serum albumin microbeads (Lee et al., 1981). The bovine serum albumin (BSA) is used to bind many drugs. This binding is reversible and retards drug release from an injection site until the albumin is degraded by enzyme proteolysis. Dilova et al. (1999) has developed a preparation of BSA microspheres associated with dexamethasone. BSA microspheres containing dexamethasone were manufactured by means of heat denaturation. About 0.1 g of dexamethasone was suspended in 10 mL of a sodium phosphate buffer and 1 g of BSA was dissolved in the suspension. 100 mL of sunflower oil was then added to the suspension and the mixture was emulsified at 1000 rpm. The resulting emulsion was added to 400 mL of preheated sunflower oil. Heating and stirring were maintained for 60 minutes at 100°C. The suspension was then allowed to cool to 25°C. After 19

Chapter One

filtration and washing with ether, the microspheres were stored at 4°C until used. An evaluation of the potential use of albumin microspheres as a drug delivery system to provide sustained release of dexamethasone in vivo has been investigated (Dilova et al., 1999). In vivo dexamethasone release from albumin microspheres was achieved for a period of a week, but non-linear release over time and declining profiles were inevitable. Therefore, another route of dexamethasone delivery is essential as intramuscular and intravenous routes failed to produce a linear drug release over time.

1.2.6.4

The vagina as a route for dexamethasone delivery

The vagina as a route of drug delivery has been known since ancient times (Hussain & Ahsan, 2005). The vaginal route offers numerous advantages as a site for drug delivery, such as convenient access, prolonged retention of formulations, a great permeation area, high vascularization, relatively low enzymatic activity, and the avoidance of hepatic first-pass metabolism. The level of interest in both local and systemic vaginal drug delivery systems has increased considerably within recent years (Bernkop-Schnürch & Hornof, 2003). In addition, various auxiliary agents some of which are permeation enhancers, such as bile salts or solubility-enhancing agents including cyclodextrins, have been developed for vaginal use to improve drug solubility and bioavailability at the site of delivery.

1.2.6.4.1

Intravaginal controlled drug delivery

The vagina has been recognized as a potential route for progesterone administration since the mid-Seventies when it was used to control oestrous cycles in cattle (Rathbone & Macmillan, 2004). Progesterone was homogenously incorporated into a silicone based type-matrix to control drug release at a predefined and reproducible rate for prolonged periods. Drug release from the polymer matrix followed a diffusion controlled process based upon Fick's Law (Rathbone et al., 2001). Initially the diffusion process starts with the elution of the solid drug near the surface of the polymer matrix. This leads to the formation of a drug depletion zone within the matrix over time. The depletion zone becomes larger and larger and the drug requires more time to diffuse to the interface 20

Chapter One

between the delivery system and the site of delivery. This increased diffusion path causes a non-linear dependence of drug release with extended time. In addition, dexamethasone compounds are ionisable unlike progesterone (a nonionisable compound), and might exhibit low solubility in a silicone matrix and a better solubility in a hydrophilic poly--caprolactone polymer (Section 2.4.1.7.3). However, the passive diffusion controlled mechanism of polymeric matrix delivery systems may be replaced by active control, such as a battery driven pump as part of an intravaginal device. More recently, IBD (Intelligent Breeding Device) and EMID (Electronically Modulated Intravaginal Device) for delivering multiple drugs simultaneously have been conceptually developed (Rathbone & Macmillan, 2004). Both the IBD and EMID use a gas controlled delivery system, which is capable of delivering multiple drugs at various times and in various patterns. A detailed comparison of the similarities and differences of the two delivery systems are elaborated on in Chapter Four (Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2). Most recently, drug delivery scientists have also developed an electronically controlled drug delivery system that is designed for use in the vagina of dairy cows (Cross et al., 2004). Unlike IBD and EMID, this device has electronic components which are built from off-the-shelf parts based on a 16-bit microcontroller and a 433.92 MHz radio transceiver placed inside a syringe. The microcontroller reads and logs sensor data and controls drug release, which is accomplished using electrolytic gas production from a gas cell the current of which is controlled by the microcontroller. Similarly, to the IBD and EMID devices, the produced gas pressure propels the syringe piston and releases the formulation. Delivery from the device could be remotely controlled from the animal or overridden via the wireless link to deliver an arbitrary and complex variable-rate profile of a drug. However, as the time the present research was carried out only IBD and EMID were available.

1.2.6.5

Hypothesis for possible solutions for induced calving

The electronically controlled drug delivery technologies could be programmed to deliver an increasing amount of drug over time, thus producing a slowly rising blood profile that would mimic closely that seen naturally. The new drug delivery system, which could deliver dexamethasone intravaginally to its desired site of 21

Chapter One

action in a controlled way to maintain effective levels for a desired period, would be an advantage. The technology may provide prolonged delivery of the drug while maintaining its blood concentration within therapeutic limits, thereby achieving a desired release profile of dexamethasone until parturition. The device could be loaded with formulated long- acting dexamethasone suspension and the rate of drug release that could be adjusted by controlling the rate of gas production by the battery driven pump.

1.2.6.5.1

Sub-hypothesis for drug delivery

As demonstrated, different dexamethasone formulations produced varied blood profiles using the same route (Toutain et al., 1982). The best dexamethasone candidate for induced calving must be identified and the goal is to identify a dexamethasone analogue with high absorption rates across the vaginal mucosa. This may be achieved by: · developing an in vitro permeation method to screen dexamethasone analogues to monitor their ability to permeate non-biological and biological membranes. · · · formulating dexamethasone analogues to enhance their aqueous solubility and permeation through these membranes. developing UV and HPLC assays to characterise the formulated dexamethasone compounds. assessing the intravaginal drug delivery system for suitability to deliver dexamethasone formulation and also to develop an appropriate release assessment method for the device. · · conducting some preliminary experiments of in vivo animal work. assessing the outcomes and recommend future work.

1.3

Oestrous synchronisation in cattle

Oestrous synchronisation is the manipulation of the reproductive cycle such that all treated cows come into oestrus at a predefined period with normal fertility (Kesler et al., 1995). Oestrous synchronisation involves administration of hormones, which are delivered in a synchronous fashion and that are released in a similar manner to by the endogenous endocrine system thereby simulating the blood level changes of these hormones in a normal oestrous cycle in cows with the aim of controlling the oestrous cycle (De Rensis & Peters, 1999; Rathbone et al., 2001). More specifically, oestrous synchronisation involves the manipulation of ovarian activity so that the time of ovulation can be predicted without the need for oestrous detection. The blood level concentration changes of progesterone and oestradiol during oestrous cycle regulates reproduction and oestrus behaviour of cows. Reliable oestrus detection in cows requires several periods of intensive daily observation and is, therefore, time consuming and expensive for dairy farmers (De Rensis & Peters, 1999). The average rate of oestrus detection is about 50% with wide variation amongst dairy farmers. This may lead to a large proportion of animals being artificially inseminated while they are not in oestrus. In addition, different farmers have different objectives in what they wish to achieve among their dairy cows and some may want to have as many cows as possible becoming pregnant by artificial insemination (AI) within a particular time span or to have calving occur a short period of time. Some other reasons why farmers would consider controlling the oestrous cycle in their dairy cattle (Rathbone et al., 2000) include: 1) reducing the time and labour costs in detecting a reliable oestrous time, 2) allowing for more cost effective implementation of timed AI programmes, 3) increasing the use of AI with fresh, transported or frozen semen in order to use desirable genes, 4) allowing seasonal breeding at optimum time in the season and 5) maximising reproductive efficiency with ovulation control programmes to provide producers with substantial opportunities to reduce production cost and enhance profitability.

23

Chapter One

Ideally, farmers want to achieve a predetermined time for effective mating with normal fertility without having to carry out oestrous detection of their herds. In addition, for cows to become pregnant and to avoid any failures of insemination, oestrus must be accurately identified (Gordon, 1996). The identification of a precise method of inducing and synchronising oestrus and ovulation in cows would be an important advance in cattle management so that cattle may be artificially inseminated at predetermined times (De Rensis & Peters, 1999). The methods of controlling the oestrous cycle, recent advances of the physiology and endocrinology of bovine oestrous cycle are discussed in the following sections.

1.3.1

Physiology and endocrinology of bovine post-partum

Cows are normally pregnant for 285 out of 365 days of a year, leaving only 80 out of 365 days to conceive following calving to maintain an optimal calving pattern (Nation, 1997). In addition, cows require several weeks to recover from calving and begin a new cycle. During this period, cows undergo a change in physiological state from pregnancy to the initiation of lactation and resumption of a fertile oestrous cycle. The period after calving is known as post-partum, which is defined as the interval from parturition to complete uterine involution (Lewis, 1997). During this period, the uterus shrinks to resume its pre-pregnancy size and ovaries regain their cyclical activity (Kindahl et al., 2004; Nation, 1997). Uterine involution may require 30 days post-partum followed by a return of the oestrous cycle (Nation, 1997). The post-partum period is divided into three sub-periods (Lewis, 1997): 1. Puerperal, the interval from parturition until the pituitary gland becomes responsive to GnRH which lasts approximately 7 to 14 day, 2. Intermediate, the interval from the time that the pituitary gland becomes responsive to GnRH to the first post-partum ovulation, 3. Postovulatory, the interval from the first ovulation to complete uterine involution. The post-partum anoestrus duration or the interval of sexual inactivity between the parturition and the following oestrous period varies considerably among cows with many contributing factors (i.e., parity, breed, health, nutrition level, body 24

Chapter One

condition, etc.) and has been reviewed by Nation (1997). Furthermore, the first ovulation is often not accompanied by oestrus, in which case, the first expression of oestrus accompanies the second ovulation, post-partum. In addition, as Nation (1997) indicated, some cows may not show any oestrous cycle for at least 60 days because of the prevalence of post-partum anoestrus. This leaves only a small chance for cows to become pregnant again, during which time they must show oestrus so they can be efficiently mated.

1.3.2

Endocrinology of the bovine oestrous cycle

The oestrous cycle is controlled by hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, where the ovarian oestradiol acts on receptor cells in the hypothalamus to secrete GnRH, which in turn, causes the release of both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland. LH and FSH promote steroid synthesis, ovarian follicular growth and ovulation. GnRH plays a crucial role in regulating ovarian activity during the normal oestrous cycle of a cow, as well as in initiating ovarian activity prior to the onset of puberty and after periods of anoestrus. The bovine oestrous cycle is generally divided into four subsequent phases and are referred to as proestrus, oestrus, metoestrus, and dioestrus, on the basis of the hormonal changes that occur (Hafs et al., 1976). The oestrous cycle is also divided into two major phases generally known as the follicular and luteal phases, on the basis of the different structures present in the ovary (Evans, 2003; Rathbone et al., 2001). The follicular phase is comprised of proestrus and oestrus and lasts from 3 to 7 days. The proestrous and oestrous periods are primarily controlled by oestrogen levels and are associated with growth of the follicle and, therefore, are called the follicular phase of the cycle. The metoestrous and dioestrous periods are associated with growth of the corpus luteum (CL), are primarily under the influence of progesterone and called the luteal phase of the cycle.

1.3.2.1

Proestrus

Proestrus is the period of the menstrual cycle that begins from the time of regression of the CL to the onset of the new oestrous cycle. The proestrus period 25

Chapter One

lasts 2-6 days during which time a dominant ovulatory follicle matures. During this maturation period, the dominant follicle produces increasing amounts of -17 oestradiol. When the -17 oestradiol levels peak in the presence of undetectable levels of progesterone, the proestrous period ends and oestrus commences (Rathbone et al., 1998).

1.3.2.2

Oestrus

Oestrus is the period of sexual receptivity in the cow and is characterised by the animal being willing to be mounted by other herd mates, both male and female (Gordon, 1996). Other behavioural signs of oestrus include vulvar swelling, restlessness, clear vaginal mucus discharge, and bellowing. Oestrus is the period of receptivity of a cow to a male. The oestrous period lasts for 8-30 hrs (Rathbone et al., 1998) or 12-24 hrs (Downey, 1980). The high circulation concentrations of -17 oestradiol that coincides with a low concentration of progesterone and initiates a surge in LH concentrations that usually exceeds 30 ng/mL (Rathbone et al., 1998), which, in turn, ruptures the follicle destined for ovulation.

1.3.2.3

Metoestrus

Metoestrus is the period that begins from the cessation of oestrus to the early development of the CL. The metoestrous period ranges between 0-5 days starting from day 0, on which ovulation takes place and is characterised by the formation of the CL (Figure 1.3). Cells of the granulosa and theca internal layers of the ruptured ovarian follicle form the CL (Gordon, 1996). These granulosa and theca internal layers start to transform and differentiate by forming large and small luteal cells, respectively. The former cells secrete progesterone and oxytocin and are responsive to PGF whereas the latter cells secrete progesterone and are responsive to LH. During the metoestrous period progesterone levels start to increase beginning on day 3 or 4 from around 1 ng/mL to 4 ng/mL (Rathbone et al., 1998).

Figure 1.3. Changes in hormone concentrations during the cow's inter-oestrous cycles (Hafs et al., 1976).

1.3.2.4

Dioestrus

Dioestrus is the period of the oestrous cycle when the CL is fully functioning and lasts for 6-18 days. During this period, the progesterone concentration produced mainly by the large luteal cells, rapidly increases from 6 ng/mL and reaches 10 ng/mL by days 8 or 9 and remain elevated for the duration of the CL life span (Gordon, 1996; Rathbone et al., 1998; Rathbone et al., 2001; Mann et al., 1998; Downey, 1980; Hafs et al., 1976) before starting to decline on day 18 (Figure 1.3).

1.3.2.5

Follicular development during the oestrous cycle

The selection of a single dominant follicle, which attains the ability for final maturation and ovulation during the oestrous cycle, culminates in ovarian follicle growth in the cattle (Mihm et al., 2002). Ovarian follicular development occurs in a wave-like pattern (Evans, 2003). Two or three waves of follicular development occur during the oestrous cycle (Soboleva et al., 2000). Each wave consists of a group of growing follicles, classified into larger dominant and smaller follicles. Over several days, one follicle grows larger than the others and is selected to 27

Chapter One

become the dominant follicle while the smaller follicles regress (Fortune, 1993). The first follicular wave emerges on day 1 of the cycle and the selection of the dominant follicle takes between days 2 and 3 of the cycle and the follicle becomes dominant between days 4 and 5 (De Rensis & Peters, 1999). The dominant follicle reaches its maximum size between days 6 and 7 of the cycle. This is followed by a period of relative stability between days 6 and 10 and then it decreases in size and is no longer identifiable by day 15. This loss of the dominant follicle coincides with emergence of a new follicle wave, preceded by a transient increase in FSH. The second dominant follicle emerges on day 10 of the cycle and will ovulate 11 days later. Animals with three follicular waves, the first, second and third follicular waves emerge on days 1, 9 and 16, respectively. The third dominant follicle ovulates 7 days later (De Rensis & Peters, 1999). Therefore, oestrous cycles with cows with two follicular waves are 2 days shorter than the three wave cycles (21 versus 23 days). However, it was found that cattle populations differ in the relative proportion of cows exhibiting two wave versus three wave cycles. Some publications have reported that 80% of cows have three wave cycles whereas others have also found that about 80% of cows have two wave cycles. It is clear that the first dominant follicle does not ovulate during the normal bovine oestrous cycle. Yet the dominant follicle that develops in the presence of functioning CL will undergo atresia due to the absence of a frequent LH pulse pattern inhibited because of high progesterone concentrations. Therefore, only the dominant nonatretic follicle that is present when the CL regresses has the opportunity to ovulate.

1.3.2.6

Luteolysis

The three hormones responsible for the initiation of luteolysis are progesterone, oestradiol and oxytocin (Goff, 2004). Together they regulate the uterine secretion of PGF that causes regression of the CL. Progesterone can regulate PGF secretion such that prolonged exposure of the endometrium to progesterone promotes the endometrial accumulation of arachidonic acid, a precursor of PGF and the cyclooxyginase enzyme which are necessary for the synthesis of PGF. On the 28

Chapter One

other hand, progesterone also exerts a suppressive effect on PGF secretion by blocking oxytocin receptor gene expression during the early and mid-luteal phases of the oestrous cycle (Ivell et al., 2000). The progesterone block to oxytocin receptors is lost after 12 days of continuous exposure, possibly due to the loss of progesterone receptors (Goff, 2004). At the end of the luteal phase, oxytocin triggers a positive feed back loop on the endometrial oxytocin receptor mediating the release of PGF, which feeds back to the CL to cause the secretion of more oxytocin and to induce luteolysis. During the luteal phase, there is an increase of oestradiol and oestradiol receptors, whereby the activated oestradiol receptors stimulates the up regulation of oxytocin receptors. The oestradiol effect is dependent on progesterone exposure to the endometrium because the effect is only observed after the endometrium has been primed by progesterone for a certain period of time. At the end of the luteal phase, the endometrium becomes responsive to oxytocin to initiate the excitability and the contraction of the myometrium. Therefore, progesterone controls the timing of luteolysis by mediation through the control of endometrial oxytocin receptors.

1.3.3

Introduction to control of the oestrous cycle

The main methods of controlling the oestrous cycle are through the manipulation of the life span of the CL by either prolonging the luteal phase or by use of progestagens or by inducing premature luteolysis by prostaglandins. Manipulation of the follicular phase by lengthening/shortening the luteal phase or inducing premature luteolysis using pharmacological hormone treatments can control the oestrous cycle (De Rensis & Peters, 1999). GnRH or human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCC) has recently been used for the manipulation of follicle development to achieve precise synchrony of ovulation. Oestrus has been synchronised in cattle with progestorone-oestradiol or progesterone-PGF combinations (Odde, 1990).

1.3.3.1

Oestrous control with PGF

Traditionally, single drug therapy for oestrous control was established once PGF was identified as the natural luteolytic hormone in cattle (Lauderdale, 1975). The 29

Chapter One

luteal phase can be terminated or shortened prematurely by intramuscular or vulvar subcutaneous injection of PGF. This compound causes regression of the CL and a decrease in circulating progesterone, thereby allowing the resumption of gonadotrophic stimulation to release GnRH which, in turn causes a surge of LH and FSH to initiate follicular development and maturation so that responding cows should show oestrous signs 2-4 days after treatment (Rathbone et al., 2001). The limitation of this method is that only 50-70% of the treated animals responded to a single administration as PGF injections can only be effective during the luteal phase of the cycle. Fertility of oestrus after PGF treatment did not differ from that of untreated animals (Odde, 1990). Assuming cows have a 21day oestrous cycle there might be two populations of cows, one which would be without CL while the other group might have a fully functioning CL (i.e., from day 5 onwards of the oestrous cycle) at the time of the treatment. All cows that have CL, are potentially responsive to PGF injection, which will cause regression of CL, reduction of blood levels of progesterone, and return to oestrus (Rensis and Peters, 1999). However, PGF treatment is ineffective during the follicular phase of the first 5 days of the oestrous cycle (Lucy, 2001). Moreover, cows injected between days 7 and 8 or 15 and 16 of the cycle showed oestrus earlier than those injected between days 12 and 14. It was suggested that the considerable variation in the interval from PGF treatment to oestrus and ovulation could be attributed to the status of the follicular wave at the time of treatment. Finally, oestrus is not synchronised precisely using PGF treatment since animals were detected in oestrus over periods of 5 days (De Rensis and Peters, 1999). Therefore, two PGF injections 11 days apart are necessary to improve synchrony of oestrus. Double PGF injections 11 days apart applied to heifers induced a high oestrous response (80-90% responding between 2-4 days), but it was less precise in the lactating cows (Gordon, 1996).

1.3.3.2

Oestrous synchronisation with progesterone

Progesterone or its analogues have been used in oestrous synchronisation programmes for cattle for many years (Whisnant & Burns, 2002). These include 1) feeding in meal, 2) injection in oil or other media, 3) subcutaneous implants, 4) by way of intravaginal devices such as PRID (Progesterone Releasing Intravaginal 30

Chapter One

Device, which consist of a stainless steel coil and looped nylon structure covered by a layer of progesterone impregnated silastic), CIDRTM-B (Controlled Internal Drug Release Device, which is made of a T-shaped nylon structure covered by a layer of progesterone impregnated silastic) or sponges (polyurethane sponges containing progesterone) (Gordon, 1996). The main biological functions of progesterone include oestrous suppression and inhibition of a pre-ovulatory LH surge during the insertion of the progesterone releasing device in the animal (Odde, 1990). The oestrous cycle resumes for a cycling cow upon the removal of a device (Kesler & Favero, 1995). Rathbone et al. (2000) have reviewed several progesterone delivery methods and their administration routes (i.e., intramuscular injection, oral administration through the diet, ear implants, and intravaginal administration) for oestrous control of domesticated livestock.

1.3.3.3

Commercial progesterone releasing intravaginal inserts for the oestrous control

Commercially available progesterone releasing intravaginal drug delivery systems include PRID, CIDRTM-B, CuemateTM, INVAS (Intravaginal Application System comprising a polypropylene spine, which is covered by progesterone matrix), Rajamehendran rubber tubing, containing progesterone and oestradiol-17 and sponges. These devices are inserted intravaginally and are usually left in place for between 7 and 12 days. Progesterone is released slowly from the device and absorbed into the system via the vaginal mucosa, the luteal phase condition will be maintained entirely by progesterone absorbed from the inserts. This will prevent oestrus and ovulation for the treatment period and all treated cows should commence a follicular phase immediately after removal of the device (Rathbone et al., 2001). It is essential that an intravaginal device is retained in an animal during the treatment. Retention rates of the PRID and CIDRTM-B are reported to be 95 and 99.2%, respectively (Rathbone et al., 2000). The CIDRTM-B is further elaborated because of the particular interest of this thesis. The CIDRTM-B has been 31

Chapter One

commercially available since 1987 (Rathbone et al., 2002). A product containing 1.92 g of progesterone (the same drug load of PRID) was initially formulated to deliver progesterone for a 12-day period based on the knowledge that progesterone provides potent suppression of oestrus and ovulation following insertion. The removal of a device causes a rapid drop in progesterone concentration in the blood circulation and promotes oestrous synchronisation within a herd and allows for mass artificial insemination to take place. The amount of progesterone released during a 15-day treatment period was highly repeatable and is dependent on the initial progesterone content (Macmillan& Peterson, 1993). In this study, however, individual treated animals showed wide variations in plasma progesterone concentrations. The progesterone blood levels achieved using commercially approved progesterone releasing products, CIDRTMB as an example, provided blood progesterone levels less than those observed (4-5 ng/mL from Rathbone et al., 2002) during the natural mid-luteal phase (9-10 ng/mL see Figure 1.3) (Rathbone et al., 2001). To date oestrous synchronisation programmes have been shortened to 7-8 days. In this period, a sustained progesterone delivery that provides a minimum plasma progesterone concentration of 2 ng/mL over the last four days of treatment is required (Rathbone et al., 1998). Since oestrous synchronisation programmes are shortened, a high residual drug load in the CIDRTM-B after removal is inevitable. Therefore, reduction of the initial progesterone load in the CIDRTM-B or reusing the CIDRTMB more than once without compromising the effective plasma profile to induce oestrous synchrony may be an advantage.

1.3.3.3.1

Re-engineering or reuse of CIDRTM-B

The residual amount of progesterone remaining in a used CIDRTM-B after removal was investigated (Ogle, 1999). Ogle (1999) found that the residual amount of progesterone was dependent upon the length of insertion and the initial progesterone load in the CIDRTM-B. Reducing the initial progesterone load would lead to a reduction in the cost of raw material (progesterone) and less environmental concerns for the disposing of waste into the environment.

32

Chapter One

The re-engineering of commercially available CIDRTM-B inserts while reducing the drug load was investigated using a shorter treatment duration of 7 days (Rathbone et al., 2002). Both the initial drug load (from 1.92 to 1.34 g) and the residual drug remaining in the product after removal (from 1.31 to 0.72g) were reduced. In addition, the lower drug load CIDRTM-B showed the same progesterone plasma levels as the commercially available CIDRTM-B. The blood profiles of the two CIDRTM-B products fluctuated between 3 and 3.5 ng/mL for the last six days of treatment (Rathbone et al., 2002). However, there was a clear difference in the plasma progesterone profiles between the commercial and re-engineered (approx 5-6 ng/mL versus 4-4.5 ng/mL, respectively) CIDRTMB products prior to day 2. This can be explained by the higher drug load product having a higher drug concentration gradient between the surface of the CIDRTM-B and the surrounding vaginal lumen fluids of the cow at the time of insertion compared to the lower drug load product. In addition, a comparative study of pregnancy rates following fixed time AI in beef cattle was investigated (Colazo et al., 2004) using CIDRTM-B inserts that have been used more than once. In this study heifers were given a new or once used CIDRTM-B (CIDRs were sterilised by autoclaving before reuse). Overall pregnancy rate was not affected by either new or once-used CIDRs in heifers treated with a new or once used CIDRTM-B (48.3% of 145/300 heifers versus 46.2% of 146/316 heifers). In the same study, cows were given once used and twice used CIDRs. Overall pregnancy rate of cows treated with once used CIDRTM-B showed a higher pregnancy rate than those treated with a twice-used CIDRTM-B (62.4% of 113/181 versus 48.4% of 88/182 cows, respectively). Furthermore, cows treated with twice used CIDR's in the same cow did not significantly improve the pregnancy rates compared to a single twice used CIDRTM-B.

1.3.3.3.2

Cuemate intravaginal inserts for the oestrous control

CuemateTM is a drug-releasing insert administered intravaginally to cattle. It contains 1.56 g of progesterone used for oestrous control purposes. It consists of a semi-rigid wishbone onto which are threaded two progesterone containing silastic 33

Chapter One

cylindrical pods which have an enclosed cap end that locks the pods in place on the wishbone (McDougall et al., 2004). An injection moulding process is used to manufacture the progesterone impregnated fluted pods of the CuemateTM. The wishbone shaped spine function facilitates the administration, retention and removal of the insert (Rathbone & Macmillan, 2004). There appears to be more than one type of commercially available CuemateTM and two types of CuemateTM with a drug load difference (1.56 g versus 1.4 g of progesterone) have been reported (McDougall et al., 2004; Hanlon et al., 2002, respectively). CuemateTM is reported to offer excellent animal comfort, efficacy and the ability to re-use the carrier "wishbone" thereby reducing costs to consumers (Hanlon et al., 2002). The CuemateTM consists of two main components, the carrier body and two treatment pods. The carrier body called a "wishbone" is used to hold the pods inside the vagina and is re-usable, being made from a plastic that can be sterilised between treatments. The two "treatment pods" are attached to the arms of the wishbone. The pods contain progesterone (1.56 g or 1.4 g, 10 % w/w) that is formulated into a silicone matrix. In a study of the comparison of the efficacy of CuemateTM and CIDRTM-B a large scale clinical trial (in 423 cows) for the treatment of anovolatory anoestrus was conducted (Hanlon et al., 2002). In this study, 51% and 49% cows were treated with CuemateTM and CIDR-BTM, respectively. All inserts were removed within six days of insertion, and 24 hours later, each cow was given an intramuscular injection of 1 mg oestradiol benzoate. This trial resulted in no significant difference between the 3-day submission rate for cows treated with a CuemateTM or CIDR-BTM (92 % versus 94 %) or the conception rate to the induced oestrus (41 % versus 43 %). This result clearly demonstrated that CuemateTM was as good as CIDR-BTM in this particular study.

Conceptual drug releasing intravaginal inserts for oestrous control

There are some developed intravaginal drug delivery technologies for progesterone and oestradiol such as IBD, PCL-CIDR (progesterone releasing 34

Chapter One

intravaginal device, which consists of progesterone homogenously dispersed in a poly--caprolactone matrix) and EMID (Rathbone et al., 2000). These drug delivery systems have been viewed by Rathbone et al. (2000). The EMID is critically evaluated in this research (Chapter Four).

1.3.3.5

Subcutaneous drug delivery systems for oestrous control

Ear implants of progestagen are available on the market that can efficiently release norgestomet (17-acetoxy-11-methyl-19-norpreg-4-ene-20, dione), which is a modified 19-norprogesterone (Kesler & Favero, 1995). Norgestomet implantation in cows for oestrous synchronisation have been reported (Kesler et al., 1995; Kesler & Favero, 1995; Kesler & Favero 1996; Kesler et al., 1997). Lower doses of the active pharmaceutical ingredient are required because norgestomet is more potent than progesterone (Kesler et al., 1995). Examples of these implants are CRESTAR® (silicon implant) and SYNCRO-MATE-B® (hydron implant). Hydron implants are manufactured with norgestomet homogeneously distributed through the hydron, whereas silicon implants contain dispersed crystalline norgestomet in a micro reservoir of aqueous PEG 400 within a matrix of polymerised silicone (Rathbone et al., 2000). The norgestomet content of both the hydron and silicon implants is 6 mg (Kesler et al., 1995). Both the hydron and silicon implants are cylinders of approximately 2.6 mm in diameter and 2.0 cm in length. These implants are inserted under the loose skin at the base of the ear using a special implantation device. Hydron implants and silicon implants have shown different in vitro drug release profiles. Silicon implants release norgestomet in a more homogenous and linear manner, while hydron implants release high quantities in the first two days and the quantity released decreases during the following days (Kesler et al., 1995). The implant is removed after 9 days by making a small incision and forcing it out. An in vivo study comparing the efficacy of hydron and silicon implants demonstrated that synchronised pregnancy rates were greater for hydron than silicon implants (53% versus 44% respectively) (Kesler et al., 1995). However, the requirement of aseptic technique during administration and the need for minor surgery to remove the implant to produce a precipitous decline in progesterone levels have resulted in this product having limited practical application (Rathbone et al., 2000). 35

Chapter One

Compared with the single hormone treatment for oestrous control, the progesterone treatments achieved excellent precision with the onset of the oestrus but with lowered fertility rates, whereas PGF treatments achieved less precision in onset of oestrus as well as variation in the fertility of individual (Rathbone et al., 1998). Other hormones such as oestradiol and GnRH have also been used alone to alter the length of the oestrous cycle, but none of these has yet been successfully adapted into single hormone oestrous control programmes like those involving progesterone or PGF, due to their variable effects. However, single hormone treatment using progesterone has only been used to a limited extent due to route specificity and poor fertility rates. Progesterone cannot prevent the development of persistent dominant follicles during treatment, but can prevent only oestrus and ovulation. Synchrony of oestrus following the use of progesterone alone was not sufficient for success with a fixed time of insemination, and therefore, other drugs are necessary to co-administer with progesterone (Whisnant et al., 1999). At the end of the treatment, any persistent dominant follicle must be induced to ovulate, otherwise, this would lead to poor fertility (Rathbone et al., 2002). Advances in endocrinology knowledge have demonstrated that the poor fertility associated with the commercial products could be overcome using shorter treatment durations with the addition of coadministered multiple hormones. For instance, >90% versus 85% of cattle can be induced to enter oestrus between 36-60 hours versus 24 hours of the end of treatment when using intravaginal inserts or subcutaneous ear implant progesterone releasing systems, with or without administering oestradiol benzoate, at the end of the treatment period (Cavalieri et al., 2004). Therefore, to achieve adequate oestrous synchronisation without compromising fertility a combination of multiple drugs administered at different rates and times throughout the treatment period is needed. For instance, additional compounds are administered at insertion or removal of a progesterone releasing device. It is well established that inclusion of oestradiol with progesterone appears to intensify the negative feedback on LH secretion compared to progesterone administered alone (Kesler & Favero, 1995). Other reasons for combined treatment are that the CL does not lyse in response to PGF until the fifth day following oestrus onwards and 36

Chapter One

oestradiol therapy increases the sensitivity of the CL to luteolytic PGF. Delivering more than a single active in combined synchronised luteolysis and ovarian follicle wave patterns could be achieved (Macmillan & Peterson, 1993).

1.3.3.6

Combination of progesterone and oestradiol for the oestrous control

A slow release formulation that involves a single intramuscular injection (i.m.) of biodegradable progesterone microspheres (progesterone + oestradiol benzoate) for controlling bovine oestrus and inducing puberty in beef heifers has been studied (Whisnant & Burns, 2002). These microspheres contained 625 mg of progesterone and 50 mg of oestradiol benzoate in poly-(DL-Lactide-co-glycolide 75:25) microspheres prepared using an emulsion based process (Rathbone et al., 2000). Progesterone plasma concentration patterns showed a rapid increase and sharp decline that may allow for oestrous synchrony. This treatment produced progesterone plasma concentrations (4-5 ng/mL) similar to that in the naturally occurring luteal phase. The follicular development and turnover were not determined in this study. About 75% of the treated cows were observed in oestrus over a two-day period. In addition, some heifers treated with a microsphere formulation containing oestradiol benzoate alone were observed in oestrus on day 1 and 2. Also, an induced earlier onset of luteal activity in perpubertal beef heifers with a consistent pattern of progesterone plasma concentrations was observed (Whisnant & Burns, 2002). Similarly, as reviewed by Rathbone et al., 2000, a biodegradable sucrose acetate isobutyrate delivery system (SABER Mate B (Bovine)) to control the release of deslorelin acetate was developed for the use of oestrous control. Combined therapies allowed treatment durations of 10 and 12 days using the subcutaneous and intra-vaginal routes, respectively (Odde, 1990; Gordon, 1996). Progesterone administered for 14 to 20 days was effective in synchronising oestrus, but this was associated with lower fertility rates (Odde, 1990). Duration of the treatment was reduced and oestrous synchronisation improved by combining progesterone with an oestradiol. SYNCHRO-MATE®-B is a typical example of progesterone-oestradiol combination. A combination of progesterone 37

Chapter One

with either oestradiol benzoate or potent progestogens with oestradiol valerate has been used for oestrous control (Rathbone et al., 1998). Synchronising the stage of the follicle wave using a combination of either oestradiol or GnRH at the start of treatment with progesterone (PRID or CIDRTM-B for 10-12 days) or the subcutaneous norgestomet (ear implants for 9-10 days) is ideal. Attaching a small gelatin capsule containing oestradiol benzoate into the inner surface of the PRID or CIDRTM-B has also been developed as a combination drug therapy for oestrous control. Cows show oestrus within a few days of removal of the implant or withdrawal of the devices. Effective treatments suppress GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus so long as progesterone administration is maintained, but the release of GnRH resumes immediately following removal of the implant or withdrawal of PRID/CIDRTM-B because of the rapid decline of progesterone concentration. Therefore, all the treated animals begin a follicular phase at the same time. More recently, McDougall et al.(2004) studied the effect of CuemateTM progesterone dose titration and oestradiol benzoate on plasma progesterone concentration and follicle dynamics in anovulatory anoestrus post-partum pasturefed dairy cattle. CuemateTM containing a normal dose (1.56 g) of progesterone or a modified CuemateTM containing double (3.12 g) or triple (4.68 g) the normal progesterone dose with (2 mg) or without oestradiol benzoate for 8 days was used. McDougall et al.(2004) found that increasing the progesterone dose was associated with an increase in plasma progesterone concentration during the time of device insertion. However, plasma progesterone concentration for each of the three doses showed similar shaped profiles with increasing levels from the lowest to the highest dose. The average values of plasma progesterone of from day 1 up to day 8 were 1.2 ± 0.2, 2.0 ± 0.2 and 2.9 ± 0.2 ng/mL for normal, double and triple CuemateTM progesterone doses, respectively. McDougall et al. (2004) also determined that there was no effect of oestradiol benzoate at the time of CuemateTM insertion on plasma concentration and concluded that a delay in the subsequent follicle wave and more rapid follicle growth were associated with the increasing progesterone dose and oestradiol benzoate treatment.

synchronisation rates in cows to 84% as compared to 57% for PGF alone (Lucy, 2001). Other researchers found similar results after cows were treated with progesterone for 7 days prior to PGF administration (Macmillan & Peterson, 1993). This occurs as all cows have a CL that has developed for at least 7 days as progesterone treatment suppresses any naturally occurring luteolysis, but does not affect any follicular development. PGF treatment ensures regression of any CL and therefore a new cycle begins. Other attempts have been made using injections of PGF or oestradiol benzoate or both in conjunction with a progesterone delivery device, PRID (Whisnant et al., 1999). It was found that the combination of progesterone, oestradiol benzoate and cloprostenol treatments resulted in significantly higher synchrony of ovulation and pregnancy rates compared with all other treatments. Oestrus synchrony of inclusion of 1 mg of oestradiol benzoate or 5 mg of -17 oestradiol with progesterone and cloprostenol was equally effective, and there were no differences between heifers and cows. Furthermore, a combination system of PGF and/or GnRH (Rathbone et al., 2001) has also been developed. The administration of GnRH induces ovulation and/or luteinization of the dominant follicle. Given that the time for a follicle to become dominant is around 8 days and dominance normally lasts about 4 days, injection of PGF 6-7 days after GnRH induces luteolysis allowing a new follicle to ovulate. A comparative study of oestrous synchronisation rates using double PGF injections, GnRH + PGF and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) +PGF was investigated (Coyan et al., 2003). Application of a GnRH or hCG prior to a PGF injection provided better oestrous synchronisation rates than two injections of PGF. This was explained by hCG (it exerts a primarily LH effect with very little of the FSH effect) and GnRH which cause ovulation or initiation of a new follicular wave. It is possible that a fully functioning CL, which is responsive to PGF treatment, is formed after 7 days of hCG and GnRH treatment. This type of treatment was effective because it controls both the follicular and luteal phases of the oestrous cycle.

1.3.3.7

Oestrous synchronisation with PGF and GnRH

As effective oestrous synchronisation of the oestrous cycle requires the control of both luteal and follicular functions, a combination of three injections of GnRH, PGF and GnRH (on days 0, 7 and 9, respectively) was developed to synchronise the follicular wave and timing of ovulation followed by a fixed time for AI. Using this method known as Ovsynch, ovulation occurs between 24 to 32 hours after the second GnRH injection. The rate of oestrous synchronisation was between 87 to 100% of lactating dairy cows. Two modifications of the Ovsynch protocol, which are referred to as Co-Synch and Select Synch have also used extensively in postpartum beef cows (Patterson et al., 2003). Co-Synch is similar to Ovsynch, and the sole difference is that cows are inseminated when the second GnRH injection is administered. Select Synch differs in that cows do not receive a second GnRH injection as in the Ovsynch protocol and they are inseminated 12 hours after oestrus is detected. However, these treatments are very expensive because of the increased number of times the animal is handled and the associated veterinarian cost needed for herd administration.

1.3.3.8

Current oestrous control programme and its deficiency

A combination of multiple drugs has become necessary to achieve affective oestrous control. The current practice of oestrous control treatment is based on the control of both luteal and follicular functions and protocols as found in the recent literature are as follows (Patterson et al., 2003; Rathbone et al., 2001; Cross et al.,2004): On day 0 CIDRTM-B is inserted to release progesterone to inhibit ovulation and oestradiol benzoate is injected intramuscularly to induce follicular atrasia. The device is removed at the end of the treatment, followed by an intramuscular injection of PGF to regress any CL. Oestradiol benzoate is injected intramuscularly on day 9 to initiate a new oestrous cycle. Therefore, there is a need for a drug delivery system that enables the delivery of multiple drugs at appropriate times. The delivery should perform a sustained release of progesterone for 7 or 8 days, as well as providing an immediate release dose of oestradiol followed by a delayed release dose of a PGF one day before removal of the device. The current drug delivery system for oestrous control is 40

Chapter One

based on a single drug delivery programme, and therefore, it cannot control the luteal and follicular functions using the same delivery system. Further research is needed to improve current oestrous control programmes. It is the aim of this research to assess an electronic drug delivery system for the delivery of progesterone, oestradiol and PGF, for the control of the bovine oestrous cycle.

Preformulation properties of selected steroids useful for administration via the intravaginal route

2.1

Introduction

Preformulation is the physicochemical characterisation of the solid and solution properties of compounds (Steele Gerry, 2004). Preformulation studies performed on a drug compound in order to produce information to enable the formulation of a stable and pharmaceutically sound drug dosage form. The physicochemical properties of a variety of steroidal compounds for the purpose of determining their suitability for incorporation into a novel intravaginal drug delivery system were determined. Although information could be found in the literature on the preformulation properties of numerous steroids, much information was lacking for the specific steroids investigated in this study. Therefore, an investigation into the physicochemical characteristics of the steroids investigated in this research was conducted. Preformulation typically involves establishing qualitative and quantitative techniques to determine the physicochemical properties of the steroids investigated in this research (Table 2.1). Some key physicochemical properties which are integral and need to be determined during drug preformulation stages are solubility, lipophilicity, ionisation constant (pKa) and permeability (Avdeef, 2001; Kerns & Di, 2004). High solubility and lipophilicity are both crucial for drug permeability across biological membranes. A low solubility is detrimental to absorption after drug administration and can cause false low estimates of compound activity in bioassay (Kerns & Di, 2004). A high hydrophilic drug can have poor passive transcellular permeability. In addition, increasing lipophilicity of a drug reduces aqueous solubility and therefore the lipophilicity and solubility may tend to cancel one another in terms of increased permeability (Schoenwald & Ward, 1978).

The common steroid molecule consists of a four-fused ring structure, three with six carbons and one with five carbons in the ring (Figure 2.1). All steroids are derivatives of this common structure (Dawson et al., 1986). The four ring structures are conventionally lettered as indicated in Figure 2.1 (A, B, C & D). The carbon position of a steroid compound is conventionally numbered according to the system listed for cholestane (Figure 2.1). There are usually methyl groups on carbon positions 10 and 13, and often an alkyl group at position 17.

Different steroids contain different functional groups attached to different positions on the molecule. For instance, some steroids studied in this research have ester groups at different carbon positions of the steroid molecule. Dexamethasone acetate and dexamethasone isonicotinate have acetate and isonicotinate groups on carbon position 21, respectively. Likewise, dexamethasone valerate has a valerate group on carbon, position 17 and dexamethasone dipropionate has propionate group on both carbon positions 17 and 21. Oestradiol benzoate has a phenolic group on carbon position 3. Steroids occur naturally in humans and animals (Osamu Nozaki, 2001) and analogues can be produced synthetically. As previously discussed in Chapter One, 44

Chapter Two

steroids are extensively used throughout the veterinary pharmaceutical industry in farm animals for the control of reproduction (e.g., progesterone and oestradiol), parturition (e.g., dexamethasone) and growth promotion (e.g., oestradiol). Testosterone is used in dogs for the purpose of chemical castration. However, the use of steroids in farm animals will be the focus of this research. Steroids are relatively insoluble in water. To increase steroid solubility and bioavailability of steroids, cyclodextrin molecules can be used (Loftsson & Brewster, 1996). Cyclodextrins are cyclic (-1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of -Dglucopyranose containing a relatively hydrophobic central cavity and hydrophilic outer surface. The most common pharmaceutical application of cyclodextrins is to enhance solubility in aqueous solution (Loftsson & Brewster, 1996). The most common cyclodextrins are -cylodextrin, -cyclodextrin and -cylodextrin, which consist of six, seven, and eight glucopyronose units, respectively. The physicochemical properties of the most commonly used cyclodextrins and some of their derivatives are summarised in Table 2.2. The size of the cyclodextrin cavity is crucial to increase steroid solubility and bioavailability (Loftsson, 1995). For example, -cylodextrin has the smallest cavity which can only be used for small molecules, whereas -cyclodextrin is the most useful for most drugs of average size range and -cylodextrin can be used for large molecules. However, a low aqueous solubility of -cyclodextrin limits its use (Loftsson, 1995). The molecular structure of the parent cyclodextrins (-cylodextrin, -cyclodextrin and -cylodextrin) has been modified to form cyclodextrins derivatives which are more soluble than their parent cyclodextrins. This has involved alkylation (methyl and ethyl derivatives) or hydroxylation (hydroxypropyl and hydroxyethyl derivatives) of the parent cyclodextrin compounds listed inTable 2.2.

2-Hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin (HPCD) was selected for use due to its high solubility (Table 2.2) in aqueous solution and its potential use to improve the bioavailability of various steroids (Usayapant & Iyer, 1999; Loftsson et al., 2003; Loftsson et al., 1994), thereby favourably altering permeation through biological and non-biological membranes.

2.2

Steroid permeation through non-biological and biological membranes using side-by-side cells

Side-by-side cells are used to screen compounds for their ability to permeate membranes. It is well documented that both non-biological and biological membranes have been used in side-by-side cells (Friend, 1992; Haigh & Smith, 1994; Zhang & Robinson, 1996). Membranes can also be classified according to their characteristics and barrier function resulting in four main groups (Loftsson et al., 2003). These four different types of membranes are: 1) lipophilic membrane barriers to drug delivery from aqueous vehicles through the membrane, 2) porous membranes that are permeable to free drug but impermeable to drug/cyclodextrin complexes, 3) porous membranes that are permeable to both free drug and 46

Chapter Two

drug/cyclodextrin complexes and 4) membranes which possess both aqueous diffusion barrier and lipophilic membrane barriers towards drug permeation. Both resistance of the lipophilic membrane and that of the adjacent aqueous boundary layer have controlled passive drug penetration across biological and non-biological membranes (Loftsson et al., 2003). Cyclodextrins can enhance drug delivery through artificial and biological membranes (Loftsson et al., 2003). Composition of a drug formulation, and the physicochemical and physiological composition of a membrane, will determine what type of enhanced effect is obtained. For instance, cyclodextrins will enhance drug delivery through diffusion control or aqueous diffusion and lipophilic controlled barriers (e.g., fish skin or hairless mouse skin membranes). The effect of cyclodextrin on in vitro drug permeation through biological membranes has been investigated (Lopez et al., 2000). It was found that cyclodextrin increased the amount of dexamethasone acetate transferred across hairless mouse skin with respect to free dexamethasone acetate in water alone. However, biological membranes suffer from a disadvantage in that they require external preparation prior to use and the viability decreases over time. Biological membranes also require sensitive analytical techniques such as HPLC to differentiate the drug from extraneous material that may leach out of the membranes. In contrast, artificial membranes offer the advantage of needing little or no preparation, are easier to use, do not require complex analytical techniques and do not deteriorate during use. However, to be of any value, they should be usable as an alternative to biological membrane and capable of predicting the permeability of compounds in vivo. Poly--caprolactone (PCL) is a polymer that is readily available, easily fabricated into thin flat sheets and low in cost (Pitt, 1990). Silicone polymer is also known to be useful for drug-loaded films that can be applied to the skin, implanted subcutaneously or inserted into several of body cavities (Juliano, 1980). In this research, permeation rates and permeability coefficients of the steroids with PCL, silicone, synthetic skin membrane and excised mucosa were investigated. An artificial model membrane was selected from the non-biological membranes for screening the steroids. 47

Infra Red (IR) spectrometry

IR spectroscopy was performed to confirm the identity of all steroids used in this research. An infrared spectrometer (Bomen, MB104, A.I. Scientific, New Zealand) with an Attenuated Total Reflectance attachment and Flat Plate Crystal was used. Three scans were performed on each sample with the instrument resolution set at 4 cm-1 and spectral range set at 3600-6000 cm-1. For each run, sufficient sample was used to completely cover the ATR crystal.

2.3.2.2

Melting point determination by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)

DSC analysis was carried out according to the method described by Vianna et al. (1998). DSC measurements were conducted using a differential thermal analysis instrument (TA Instruments, DSC 2920, USA) linked to a data analysis station (Thermal Solution 1.2J, TA Instrument). DSC thermal analysis was performed in order to define the melting point of pure and formulated steroidal compounds used in this research. All the DSC traces for the melting point of each sample were analysed by measuring heat flow differences between the sample and a reference. Samples of materials of weight 4-7 mg were accurately weighed in hermetic sealed aluminium pans and scanned over a temperature range of 25-270 °C at a heating rate of 10°C/minute and with an air flow rate of 50 mL/minute. An empty sealed hermetic aluminium pan was chosen as the reference sample. A graph of heat flow (mW) versus temperature (ºC) was plotted from the generated data. The intersection of the extrapolated baseline prior to the transition with the extrapolated leading edge of the transition of the heat flow versus temperature graph was taken as an extrapolated onset melting temperature (Clas et al., 1999). The peak temperature (Tm) was also obtained from the graphs for all the steroids.

The mixtures were allowed to equilibrate in a water bath (Grant OLS200 Shaking Water Bath, Grant Instruments Ltd, UK) at 39ºC at 50 strokes per minute for a week. The mixtures were centrifuged (Beckman, AvantiTM 30 Centrifuge, Beckman Instruments, Inc., USA) at 5700 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatants were removed from the aqueous drug/cyclodextrin sediments and freeze-dried. Solid complexes of oestradiol benzoate or oestradiol-17 with CD or HPCD were obtained from saturated solutions of oestradiol benzoate or oestradiol-17 in the presence of the appropriate cyclodextrin (5% w/v cyclodextrin in PBS at pH 5.0). The supernatant was removed and freeze-dried to obtain a dry powder for DSC analysis. Physical mixtures were obtained by direct mixing of either the oestradiol benzoate or oestradiol-17 and cyclodextrin and mixing at a ratio of 1:4 drug to cyclodextrin. Approximately 0.200 and 0.210 grams of oestradiol-17 were weighed in separate glass bottles and mixed with 0.800 grams of CD or 0.840 grams of HPCD, respectively. Similarly, 0.269 and 0.290 grams of oestradiol benzoate and 1.076 grams of CD or 1.160 grams of HPCD, were prepared in the same manner.

Solubility of the steroids

Solubility was determined at 39ºC by adding excess drug to the aqueous phase (5% w/v HPCD in PBS, pH 5.0) and equilibrated in a water bath at 50 strokes per minute for 7 days. At periodic times samples were taken from the solution to provide evidence that equilibration had occurred. All samples were extracted from the supernatant using a syringe and passed through a 0.22 m Millipore filter (preheated to 39ºC in an oven) with the first 2 mL being discarded. The sample was then appropriately diluted and analysed by UV spectroscopy at the peak of maximum absorbance (max) of the steroids. The blank was 5% w/v HPCD in pH 5.0 PBS. Determination of solubility values was performed in duplicate samples on three different days for each steroid. 51

2.3.2.3.1

Apparent association/dissociation constant (Kc) of drug-HPCD complex

In an aqueous cyclodextrin solution, when a drug forms a complex with cyclodextrin, the drug molecule, in part or in whole, is taken up into the somewhat lipophilic cylodextrin cavity (Loftsson et al., 2003). Then, the free drug molecule goes into equilibrium with the drug-cylodextrin complex. The equilibrium constant (association/dissociation constant) is Kc. The solubility of steroids was determined in various concentrations of HPCD (0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 and 12.5% w/v) in PBS (pH 5.0) at 39ºC as described in Section 2.3.2.3. All samples were extracted from the supernatant using a syringe and passed through a 0.22 m Millipore filter (preheated to 39ºC in an oven) with the first 2 mL being discarded. The sample was then appropriately diluted and analysed by UV at the max of the relevant steroid. A blank was used that contained the same concentration of HPCD in pH 5.0 PBS as the solution studied. The solubility of each drug versus the HPCD concentration was plotted to determine the slope. A plot of drug solubility versus cyclodextrin is called a phase solubility diagram (Loftsson et al., 2002; Loftsson et al., 2003). The phase solubility diagrams are used to calculate, the apparent association/dissociation constant (Kc). The linear phase solubility diagrams are thought to indicate that the drug-cylodextrin complexes are first order with respect to cyclodextrin and first or a higher order with respect to the drug (Loftsson et al., 2002). If a water-insoluble drug molecule forms a complex with one cyclodextrin molecule, Kc (1:1), then Kc of the complex can be determined by the phase solubility method. When the aqueous solubility of the drug shows a linear increase when plotted as a function of the cyclodextrin concentration, Kc can be determined from the initial linear slope and the solubility of the drug in water (Co), according to Equation 2.1 (Babu & Pandit 2004).

Kc =

Slope C o (1 - Slope )

Partition coefficients

A partition coefficient is a measure of the relative hydrophobicity of a compound (Kerns & Di, 2004). Generally, the partition coefficient is calculated from the relative distribution of a compound between a water immiscible organic solvent (e.g., octanol) and an aqueous buffer at varying pH. For instance, the octanolwater partition coefficient of a compound is the ratio of the concentration of the compound in octanol and in aqueous buffer at equilibrium and at a specified temperature and pH (Kerns, 2001).

2.3.2.4.1 Partition

Octanol: 5% w/v HPCD buffer (pH 5.0) coefficients were determined using the shake-flask method

(Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1979; Kerns, 2001). Partition coefficients were determined between octanol and 5% w/v HPCD buffer (pH 5.0) at 39ºC in triplicate on two different days for each of the steroids investigated in the study. The absorbance of each steroid was measured using UV spectrophotometer. Pre-saturation of the two phases was carried out prior to the experiment. The two phases (n-octanol and the aqueous HPCD-containing buffer) were pre-saturated in a separating funnel at 39ºC in an oven for six days. Pre-saturated aqueous phase was used to make a known concentration of drug solution and 25 mL of this was added to a 100 mL bottle. The appropriate volume of organic phase was then carefully added on top of the aqueous phase. The bottle contents were then gently shaken to equilibration in a water bath maintained at 39ºC for 24 hours (t = ). At equilibration, absorbance values (Abs) were determined. Apparent partition coefficients were calculated according to Equation 2.2.

PCL: 5% w/v HPCD in PBS buffer (pH 5.0) partition coefficients

Partition coefficients of the steroids were also determined by the shake-flask method between the PCL membrane and 5% w/v HPCD in PBS buffer (pH 5.0) at 39ºC in triplicate on two different days for each of the compounds investigated in the study. The absorbance of the drug analogue was measured using a UV spectrophotometer. Very thin PCL sheets were prepared by placing PCL beads between two flat metal plates which were compressed between the jaws of a bench vice. The PCL sheets obtained were then cut into small pieces and used in the study. Partition coefficients were determined as described using Equation 2.2 except that r = phase weight (aqueous phase weight/PCL sheets weight) in this case.

2.3.2.5

Ionisation constant and partition coefficient (octanol/water) values

The charge state that a molecule exhibits at a particular pH is characterised by the ionization constant (pKa) of that molecule (Avdeef, 2001). Unless otherwise stated the pKa and partition coefficient in octanol/water values of the steroids studied in the thesis were found via www.scifinder.com. According to this web address, the pKa values were calculated using Advanced Chemistry Development (ACD) Software Solaris V4.67 (© 1994-2003 ACD).

Side-by-side cell permeation Apparatus description

The side-by-side diffusion cells used in this study were obtained from Crown Glass Co. Inc. (Somerville, New Jersey, USA). They are comprised of two half cells (donor and receptor) that were assembled in a purpose built rack which had a threaded screw on one side and when tightened, allowed a pressure seal to be made against the membrane and the half-cells. Each half-cell had a volume of 3.4 mL and provided a surface area for permeation of 0.785 cm2. The donor cell was 54

Chapter Two

loaded with excess steroid in 5% w/v HP--cyclodextrin [(2-Hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin (Wacker-Chemie GMBH, Germany)] in pH 5.0 phosphate buffer. The receptor cell was filled with 5% w/v HP--cyclodextrin in pH 5.0 phosphate buffer. The contents of each half-cell were stirred with small magnetic stirring bars (Spinbar, Stirring Bar, Teflon, Flea Micro, 7 x 2 mm., Pequannock, NJ, USA), which were rotated from the outside of the cell by a magnetic stirrer. Shallow round depressions in the interior of the cell held the stirrers close to but not touching, the membrane's surface. The permeation experiments were conducted at 39ºC using a thermal instrument (Thermomix 1419 Pump, KMS Ltd., NZ) jacketing of the cells to supply recirculating water to maintain temperature control. The thermal jacket extended all the way to the membrane surface. A diagram of the side-by-side apparatus used in the study is shown in Figure 2.3.

Samples of the receptor phase were taken at defined time intervals, with a disposable plastic pipette (Total Lab System Ltd, Auckland, NZ) and accurately weighed (Sartorius Analytical Balance Type BP110S, Biolab Scientific Ltd, NZ) and then, if required, diluted with an appropriate volume of buffer before analysis by UV spectrophotometry (Beckman DU® 640, Beckman, USA). For each sample, an equal volume of buffer was added to the receptor phase and correct selection of the aqueous phase composition ensured that sink conditions prevailed in the receptor phase throughout the duration of the experiment. A single drug candidate and the selected model membrane were used to identify the factors that may affect drug permeation, such as, membrane thickness, temperature, pH and hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin concentration in the donor phase.

2.3.2.6.2.1. Selection of non-biological membrane Initial studies investigated several different types of membranes including silicone (150 m thickness), synthetic skin (50 m thickness) and PCL (140 m thickness).

2.3.2.6.2.2. Synthetic skin Synthetic skin membrane was obtained directly from the manufacturers (CoTranTM 9702 (2 mil, 9% vinyl acetate) 3M Pharmaceuticals, USA).

2.3.2.6.2.3. Silicone Silicone membranes were obtained from DEC Manufacturing, (558 Te Rapa Road, Hamilton, NZ) and were manufactured using a purpose-built mould by injection moulding degassed 50:50 mixtures of Part A and Part B liquid silicone and curing at a temperature of 190ºC. Following manufacture, membranes were characterised by randomly sampling 10 membranes and their thickness determined using a micrometer screw gauge (Shardlow Micrometers Ltd, Sheffield, England).

Chapter Two

2.3.2.6.2.4. Poly--caprolactone PCL membranes were manufactured in-house using two highly polished aluminium plates of dimensions (165 x 100 x 11.5 mm), which were separated using feeler gauges to give a membrane thickness of 140 m (Figure 2.4). There were some occasions where different membrane thicknesses were manufactured by using feeler gauges of different thicknesses.

Figure 2.4. Photograph of plates, PCL bead and feeler gauges used to manufacture PCL membranes.

PCL beads were placed on to the surface of one of the plates (Figure 2.4) and heated to 120ºC in a bench top oven (Sunbeam Bake and Grill, BT020A model, Sunbeam, New Zealand) for 30 minutes to ensure they were molten. The plate was removed and the second plate (also preheated to 120ºC) was placed on top of the first. The two plates were then squeezed between the jaws of a vice and the plates compressed together. A screw knob on one side of the vice was tightened against the plates to ensure that uniform pressure is applied on the membrane in each time. They were left under pressure until the plates equilibrated to ambient temperature (approximately 60 minutes). At this point, the plates were separated and the membrane removed. The thickness of the membrane was determined using a micrometer screw gauge by measuring five different points on the membrane and averaging the five values (Figure 2.5).

Stability of membrane

PCL membranes were subjected to scanning electron micrography (SEM) to determine if changes in the surface properties of the membrane (as an indication of the stability of the membrane) during the permeation experiment occurred. The surface of the membrane was compared to the surface properties of a freshly prepared membrane. 58

2.3.2.6.3

Effect of changing conditions

The following conditions were changed to examine their effect upon dexamethasone permeation through PCL membranes of 140 m thickness: 1. Membrane thickness: 70 to 200 m thickness. 2. Temperature: 25, 30, 35 and 39ºC. 3. Cyclodextrin concentration: 1.25, 2.5, 5, 7.5% w/v in PBS/pH 5.0. 4. pH of the donor phase: 5, 7.4, 10 in 5% w/v in PBS. 5. Sensitivity: 140, 141, 145, 146, 148 m thickness. 2.3.2.6.4 Screening of compounds through non-biological membranes

Unless otherwise stated, the permeation rates of all compounds studied in this research were determined using PCL membranes (~140 µm) and the chosen conditions (39ºC and 5% HPCD in PBS at pH 5.0) in side-by-side cells. The aim was to rank the studied steroids in order of their permeation rates.

2.3.2.6.5

Excised cow vaginal mucosa (biological membranes)

The permeation rates of dexamethasone, dexamethasone acetate, dexamethasone valerate, dexamethasone isonicotinate, dexamethasone dipropionate and progesterone were also determined using the side-by-side cell apparatus and excised vaginal mucosa. Excised vaginal mucosa was used as the membrane separating the two half-cells. The mucosa was obtained in a fresh state from Ruakura Abattoir (Hamilton, NZ), put in a clean plastic bag, transferred to the laboratory on ice. The membrane was used fresh or kept in a freezer (-18°C) and thawed to room temperature prior to use. The mucosa was dissected from the majority of the connective tissue without damaging it by cutting along the outside length of the fresh vaginal sample with a scalpel until it reached the inner section. This opened up and exposed the vaginal mucosal surface. The sample was then averted to expose an excised mucosa with relatively low degree of folding. The vaginal mucosa was then laid uppermost. Excess mucus was removed. The edge of the mucosa was grasped with fine forceps, stretched and cut between the lamina propria and the mucosa by allowing the tissue to hung while cutting submucosa using surgical blades (Swann Morton Ltd, Sheffield England). The blade was held in parallel position to the inner surface (submucosal side of the 59

Chapter Two

mucosa) to cut the mucosa, which then could be peeled away easily in sheet form. A 6.0 cm diameter piece of the mucosal sheet was then taken and the thickness of the dissected piece measured at five positions (see Figure 2.5) using a micrometer screw gauge to determine thickness. This was then cut into two equal parts and mounted onto the side-by-side cells with the surface of the vaginal mucosa facing towards the donor phase. The average thickness of the tightly stretched dissected mucosa was found to be between 1.0 and 1.2 mm. The side-by-side cell study was performed under sink conditions over 10-12 hours. The donor cell was loaded with excess steroid in 5% w/v HP--cyclodextrin in pH 5.0 phosphate buffer. The receptor cell was filled with 5% w/v HP--cyclodextrin in pH 5.0 phosphate buffer. The temperature was maintained at 39ºC. A 1.0 mL sample was taken at selected time intervals (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0 hours) and analysed for drug concentration by a validated HPLC assay for each steroid such that changes in the drug concentration in the receptor phase and rate of transfer through mucosa could be monitored. An equal volume (1.0 mL) of 5 % w/v HP--cyclodextrin in pH 5.0 phosphate buffer was added to replace the volume that had been removed. The peaks of the HPLC chromatogram generated from the analysed sample response were compared to those obtained the drug standards to see the effect of the mucosa on the drug. The concentration of a steroid transferred across the mucosal membrane at specific time in the receptor phase was calculated using the peak area and a standard calibration curve (peak area versus concentrations). The cumulative amount permeated drug appearing in the receptor phase (g) versus time (hours) was plotted and analysed as described in Section 2.3.2.6.2 to determine the permeation rates of the studied drugs.

2.3.2.6.6

Analysis of data obtained using side-by-side cells

This study was carried out to investigate if there is any correlation between the physicochemical properties of the studied steroids (i.e., partition coefficient, solubility, HPLC retention time and/or molecular weight) and permeation 60

Chapter Two

rates/permeability coefficients through the PCL model membrane and excised vaginal mucosa. Permeation rates and permeability coefficients across the PCL membrane were calculated for each steroid and their values were plotted against their respective log ocatanol-buffer partition coefficients. In addition, the permeation rate data generated using the selected model membrane will be evaluated to predict the permeation rate of selected steroids across excised vaginal mucosa in side-by-side cells. The permeation rate was determined from the slope of the cumulative amount of steroid appearing in the receptor phase as a function of time (t) when steady-state transfer was occurring as follows. Note the membrane flux (which is the amount of steroid that can be passed through a square unit of area) can be calculated from the permeation rate divided by the surface area (0.785 cm2). The slope is the cumulative amount of the tested steroid over time (Q/t). Therefore from knowledge of the slope, the initial solubility of the steroid in the donor phase, C0, and the surface area available for transfer, A, the permeability coefficient, P can be calculated from (Artursson & Karlsson, 1991; Civiale et al., 2004) Equation 2.3.
Q = PAC 0 t

Equation 2.3.

Therefore, the permeability coefficient can be calculated by rearranging Equation 2.3 to give:
Slope AC 0

P=

Equation 2.4.

However, for a water-insoluble steroid (when C0 is practically impossible to experimentally determine) the permeability of some steroids across PCL membrane was alternatively determined using Equation 2.5 (Martin et al., 1983). 61

Disappearance of the original endothermic peaks of oestradiol benzoate and oestradiol-17 is clearly seen in the complex thermograms (Figure 2.7). This might be due to possible complex formations between oestradiol benzoate or oestradiol-17 and HPCD or CD. In addition, the shape change of the original endothermic peak of CD is obvious in the oestradiol benzoate or oestradiol-17CD complex samples.

There are shifts of the original endothermic peaks of oestradiol benzoate and oestradiol-17 in the case of oestradiol benzoate or oestradiol-17 and HPCD or CD complexes. This might be due to potential complex formation of oestradiol benzoate or oestradiol-17 and HPCD or CD.

It was impossible to determine the solubility values of dexamethasone isonicotinate, dexamethasone dipropionate, oestradiol benzoate and oestradiol-17 in PBS (pH 5.0) alone due to insufficient solubility in the buffer and low UV sensitivity.

The Kc values of dexamethasone isonicotinate, dexamethasone dipropionate, oestradiol17 and oestradiol benzoate could not be calculated because the initial solubility (C0) value of these steroids could not be determined in the buffer alone. 67

From Table 2.14 it can be seen that the much thicker PCL membranes (150 µm) showed lower permeation rates, and therefore diffusion of dexamethasone across the thicker membrane would take longer. The thinner membranes (120 µm) showed higher permeation rates with some considerable variation. Improving permeation rates with less variation and need of reasonable time of diffusion across the membrane, 140 µm thick PCL was considered for further study. The 72

Screening of steroids across excised mucosa

Table 2.17 shows the flux and permeation rates of the different steroids across excised vaginal mucosa. It was found that some steroids, which have an ester group on carbon position 21 such as dexamethasone acetate, dexamethasone isonicotinate and dexamethasone dipropionat, were found to hydrolyse. Dexamethasone was identified as a secondary compound of ester hydrolysis product of dexamethasone acetate and dexamethasone isonicotinate. 74

Table 2.18 shows the permeation rates of the ester hydrolysis product of dexamethasone acetate and dexamethasone isonicotinate across excised vaginal mucosa. The ester hydrolysis of dexamethasone dipropionate were observed on the chromatogram but not quantified due to not having a reference compound (e.g., dexamethasone-17-propionate). The peak due to the ester hydrolysis product was well separated from the principal peak due to dexamethasone dipropionate.

Chapter Two

Progesterone and dexamethasone showed the highest and the lowest permeability values across the excised mucosa, respectively. This is possibly due to the relative molecular size and degree of lipophilicity of progesterone compared to dexamethasone, dexamethasone acetate and dexamethasone valerate which may all contribute to the ranks of permeability values.

The IR spectrum was analysed and the principle peaks were compared to those found in the literature for the same compounds or their chemical structures. The comparison is shown in Table 2.20.

The close agreement between the literature values and the experimentally determined IR values seen in Table 2.20 indicates that each of the steroids used in the study were as described by the supplier. The DSC traces were analysed and 76

Chapter Two

endothermic melting peaks shown by the thermographs were compared to the reported melting point peak values for the steroids used in the study. Literatures values and experimentally determined DSC values for the steroids used in the study are shown in Table 2.5. Melting is an endothermic process in which the sample takes in a net quantity of heat (Clas et al., 1999). A 100% pure crystalline compound shows a sharp melting endothermic change. The presence of impurities or crystalline defects lead to a broadening of the melting endotherm and to a lowering of the melting temperature. According to the literature, the onset temperature where the transition temperature starts to deviate from the baseline can describe a melting endotherm. The extrapolated onset melting temperature is reported as the temperature at the intersection of the extrapolated baseline prior to the transition with the extrapolated leading edge of the transition. The endothermic melting peak is defined as the peak temperature (Tm). Extrapolated onset temperature and literature values shown in Table 2.5. The close agreement between the literature values and the experimentally DSC values seen in Table 2.5 again indicates that each of the steroids used in the study were pure as described by the supplier.

2.5.2

Oestradiol-cyclodextrin Complexation

Complexation leads to changes in the physicochemical properties of the steroids used in this study. The extrapolated onset melting peak temperatures for the oestradiol/cyclodextrin complexes investigated in the study are shown in Table 2.6. DSC thermograms showed endothermic peaks corresponding to the melting points of oestradiol benzoate, oestradiol-17, CD and HPCD in physically mixed samples (Table 2.6), as shown in Figure 2.7. This indicates that there was no potential interaction between CD or HPCD and the oestradiols. The endothermic peaks for oestradiol benzoate or oestradiol-17 were absent in the thermograms from samples prepared from saturated solution. However, CD and HPCD melting peaks were always present with slight shifts. Broadening and 77

Chapter Two

lowering of the melting temperatures seen for oestradiol and cyclodextrin are due to complex formation. The broadening is much more pronounced in the case of CD than HPCD. Presumably this is due to a different central cavity diameter (7.5-8.3 for CD, 6.0-6.5 Å for HPCD) (Loftsson et al., 1996; Loftsson et al., 2003). It is possible that the drug has more central cavity space to interact with when CD is used compare to HPCD. The disappearance of the oestradiol benzoate or oestradiol-17 melting peaks in the complex samples showed that there was a possible interaction between the drug and cylodextrin. This might be due to CD or HPCD oestradiol complexes being in an amorphous state. A similar explanation was given (Babu & Pandit, 2004) when inclusion of complexes of bupranolol with cyclodextrin were characterised by DSC and the melting point of bupranolol was found to completely disappear. However, further analysis of the pure samples and their complexes using X-ray diffractometry might explain the presence of the amorphous state further.

2.5.3

Solubility and association/dissociation constants (Kc)

The use of the drug carrier cyclodextrin is to improve the solubility and bioavailability of the steroids across artificial or/and biological membranes (Lopez et al., 2000). The phase-solubility diagram of dexamethasone in aqueous HPCD solution was investigated (Loftsson et al., 1994). The solubility increased linearly as a function of HPCD concentration with a slope of less than unity and, thus, formation of a 1:1 complex could be assumed. The Kc value of the dexamethasone-HPCD inclusion complex was determined to be 1230 M-1. The phase-solubility diagram in aqueous HPCD (0-12.5%w/w in PBS/pH 5.0) solution of steroids used in this study has been p shown in Figure 2.8 (see Section 2.4.1.4.1). The solubility of all studied steroids was found to increase with an increase in HPCD concentration. This is in agreement with data reported in the literature (Usayapant & Iyer 1999). The increase in aqueous solubility of the steroids is evidence of formation of a water-soluble drug HPCD (1:1) inclusion 78

Chapter Two

complex (Loftsson et al., 1994). In addition, a slope of less than unity (Kc) suggests the formation of a drug-cyclodextrin (1:1) complex. Moreover, the disappearance of the oestradiol benzoate or oestradiol-17 melting peaks in DSC scans of HPCD complexes samples showed that there was interaction between the steroids and cyclodextrin (see Section 2.5.2). The ranking order of solubility profile dependency on HPCD content increase was progesterone, oestradiol-17, dexamethasone, dexamethasone acetate, dexamethasone valerate, oestradiol benzoate, and dexamethasone isonicotinate and dexamethasone dipropionate (Figure 2.8). It seems that structural complexity (perhaps presence of attached groups on steroid compound such as ester chains), size and the initial solubility of these steroids all contribute to give different solubility diagram profiles. It was found that the total amount of drug in solution is a function of both the intrinsic solubility of the drug in the absence of cyclodextrins and of the complexation constant, Kc, and sometimes the two effects can cancel out (Stella et al., 1999). In addition, the solubility of most drugs increases with increasing temperature. West (2003) reported that the body temperature of a cow might vary between 38.9 and 39.4ºC. In addition, any product resulting from this research would be intravaginally administered into cows. It was therefore decided to conduct the preformulation experiments at a temperature of 39ºC. According to the literature, the formation rate constant of the drug/cyclodextrin complex was found to be close to that of a diffusion controlled process and weakly dependent on structure of the drug and Kc, while the dissociation rate constant was very structure sensitive and inversely proportional to Kc (Stella et al., 1999). The linear phase solubility diagrams of dexamethasone and dexamethasone acetate Kc values (Table 2.8) are in agreement with data reported in the literature. In this study, the Kc values for complex formation were 892 and 1121 M-1 versus literature values of 1230 (Loftsson et al., 1994) and 2240 M-1 (Usayapant et al., 1991) for dexamethasone and dexamethasone acetate, respectively.

79

Chapter Two

In principle, drug/cyclodextrin complexes may dissociate due to a decrease in Kc as the complex is exposed to a pH, which changes the charge status of either the drug or the cyclodextrin (Stella et al., 1999). Additionally, binding of drugs to cyclodextrins has been shown to be an exothermic process (H is negative). Hence, any increase in temperature results in a weakening of the complex, and thus an increase in the free fraction of drug. This can explain lower values of Kc of the studied steroids compared with values of 39°C versus 23-25°C, respectively.

2.5.4

Side-by-side-cells and using non-biological membranes

Various non-biological membranes were investigated in side-by-side cell experiments. Synthetic skin of known thickness (50 µm) was used as received. However, the membranes that were manufactured by DEC Manufacturing or inhouse were characterised in terms of their thickness and uniformity of thickness. The silicone membranes manufactured by DEC Manufacturing (Figure 2.9) were shown to exhibit a uniform thickness with an average thickness of 150 ± 8 µm ranging from 140.0 to 166 µm. PCL membranes manufactured in-house for use in the study (Figure 2.6) were also shown to exhibit a uniform thickness with an average of 143.1 ± 5.0 µm ranging from 138.0 to 148 m. Initially, the effect of membrane composition on the permeation of two compounds (dexamethasone and dexamethasone acetate) was studied in order to identify a membrane for use in future experiments. Three membranes were investigated: silicone, synthetic skin and PCL. Several criteria were identified that the membrane should meet for use in these studies. These included: (i) ready availability or ease of manufacture; (ii) sufficiently cheap to purchase or manufacture; (iii) exhibition of a reproducible thickness; (iv) stability for the duration of the side-by-side cell studies (up to 7 days); (v) permeability to the steroids used in the study. Each of the membranes investigated fulfilled criteria (i) to (iv), however, the membranes were observed to vary in their permeability toward steroids. Permeation rates for dexamethasone and dexamethasone acetate across the membranes were ordered from the slowest to the fastest as follows synthetic skin followed by silicone followed by PCL (Figure 2.11). 80

The high permeability of PCL led to it ultimately being chosen as a membrane for use in this reseasrch, since it resulted in high steroid concentrations appearing in the receptor phase thus allowing for easy and accurate detection of the steroids by a simple UV analytical method. The high permeability of PCL also meant that the duration of an experiment could be reduced (compared to the other membrane types) and yet still provides an accurate estimate of the permeation rate. However, in contrast to silicone membrane or synthetic skin, the PCL membrane is a degradable polymer. Therefore, it was important to show that the membrane was not degrading over the time course of an experiment. An experiment was initiated using dexamethasone and dexamethasone acetate that studied the effect of 7 days exposure of the membrane to the aqueous phase used in the side-by-side cell studies on the stability of the PCL membrane. SEM photomicrographs revealed that freshly manufactured and exposed membranes had the same surface characteristics suggesting that no degradation had taken place. In addition, the linearity (R2 0.9996) of the appearance of the steroids in the receptor phase suggests that no degradation of the membrane is occurring during the course of the experiment (Figure 2.12).

Cyclodextrin concentration was also seen to affect the rate of permeation of dexamethasone. As the concentration of cyclodextrin was increased in the donor phase, the rate of permeation increased (Figure 2.15). Since passive diffusion is driven by high drug concentration in the aqueous vehicle, the increase of dexamethasone in solution can explain the increase of dexamethasone permeation through the PCL membrane. This was in agreement with what is reported in the literature (Loftsson et al., 1994).

In addition, changing the pH of the receptor phase to pH 10 (from pH 5) had no effect upon permeation rate. It is expected that ionised species penetrate poorly through the membranes compared with non-ionised species (Mashru et al., 2005). The effect of pH on the rate of permeation would be expected to be negligible due to the fact that dexamethasone has a pKa value greater than 12.0 which is at least two or more pH units away from the range of the tested pHs.

Figure 2.17. Effect of steroids on rate of permeation profiles through PCL membranes (Mean ± SD, N=2).

The permeation rate profiles of the various steroids significantly varied. Progesterone showed the highest permeation rate of all tested steroids. There is a trend of decreasing permeation rate from oestradiol-17, oestradiol benzoate to dexamethasone analogues (Figure 2.17). Haigh & Smith (1994) have reported that the steroid partition coefficient between donor or receptor phase and the membrane is the most important variable that can affect the permeation process. The different permeation rate profiles could be explained by different solubility, lipophilicity, relative molecular size and molecular shape among the steroids. The permeation rate is function of the steroid concentration in the donor phase as well as the partition coefficient (Schoenwald & Ward, 1978) between the steroid and the membrane. Figure 2.18 shows the relationship between permeation rates versus partition coefficient expressed in LogP at octanol: pH 5/5%HPCD, retention time on 85

It can be seen from Figure 2.19(a-b) that as the LogP and retention time of the compound increase, so does its permeability coefficient. However, other physicochemical properties did not show any obvious correlation with the permeability coefficients of the steroids. Both the partition coefficient and retention time indicate the lipophilicity of the steroids. Since the partition coefficients and retention time showed a correlation with the permeation rates, the PCL appears to be non-porous and lipophilic membrane. The PCL membrane appears to offer some rate-limiting step to steroids permeation. This type of barrier function is inherited to the membrane for which only dissolved free drug molecules will have to partition from the aqueous donor to the membrane (Loftsson et al., 2003). Therefore, the lipophilicity between the membrane and drug reflects the ability of the drugs to leave the donor phase and partition into the membrane (Figure 2.19a). The use of PCL as a model membrane in side-by-side 87

Chapter Two

cell experiments results in the advantage that compounds rapidly permeate through it, resulting in the need for less sensitive analytical techniques to be developed and potentially only short experimental times can be used to generate sufficient data to provide a reliable estimate of the permeation rate. In addition, the PCL membrane can be used for showing a sufficient discriminatory power between steroidal dosage forms.

2.5.5

Side-by-side-cells using excised mucosal membranes

All of the steroids studied permeate across excised mucosal membranes with varying permeation rates. A typical curve of the cumulative amount of steroid permeated through excised mucosa over time (i.e., dexamethasone valerate) is shown in Figure 2.20a. Some other examples are shown in Appendix-D. A linear (R2 0.9986) relationship was obtained when the total amount of each steroid analogue in the receptor phase was plotted against time. Therefore, the dexamethasone analogues and progesterone permeation through excised mucosa transport can be described by zero order kinetics. Figure 2.20a exhibits a lag time (the time before establishing steady state concentration across membrane) which was not used in the calculation of the linear portion of the curve to determine the slope of the line. An example of a typical curve that is used for permeation rate calculations of the steroids studies is shown in Figure 2.20b.

Chapter Two

Some steroids showed higher permeation rates than others, as previously shown in Table 2.17. This could be a possible combination of the steroid lipophilicity and the concentration gradient between the two sides (donor and receptor phase) of the membrane. Dexamethasone acetate, dexamethasone isonicotinate and dexamethasone dipropionate showed ester bond hydrolysis when the excised mucosal membrane was used. In addition, no secondary product was found when dexamethasone acetate and non-biological membranes (i.e. silicone or PCL membrane) were used in side-by-side cells. Therefore, it is possible that some esterase enzymes are present in the vaginal mucosa membrane which are specific enough to cleave the ester bond at the carbon 21 position of dexamethasone acetate, dexamethasone isonicotinate and dexamethasone dipropionate. This possibility is supported by other researchers who found that dexamethasone ester hydrolysis was occurring in biological tissues due to esterase enzymes (Lopez et al.,2000 & Civiale et al., 2004). In addition, other researchers found that dexamethasone was released from dexamethasone isonicotinate or dexamethasone sodium phosphate due to ester hydrolysis and was available in the systemic circulation immediately following intravenous or intramuscular administration (Toutain et al., 1982; Welch et al., 1973; Fairclough et al., 1981a). Interestingly, the dexamethasone ester on the carbon 17 position (i.e. dexamethasone valerate) did not show any secondary metabolic products. This suggests the presence (in the excised mucosa) of a stereo-specific enzyme, which only cleaves at a specific ester bond. From the chemical structure of dexamethasone esters on the carbon 21 position, which is more exposed to enzymatic hydrolysis reactions, seems to be more susceptible to the hydrolysis unlike position 17 esters, which is perhaps due to possible steric hindrance and stereospecifity of the enzymes causing the hydrolysis. Further evidence is that one secondary product was found from dexamethasone dipropionate, which has two ester bonds on carbon position, 17 and 21. The carbon position 21 ester bond was likely to be cleaved perhaps due to its lack of steric hindrance and thereby susceptibility to the hydrolysis as shown by the ester hydrolysis on carbon position 21 of dexamethasone acetate or dexamethasone isonicotinate.

Chapter Two

Figure 2.21 shows the correlation of permeation rates between PCL and excised mucosa. It can be seen from Figure 2.21 the permeation rate values using PCL cannot predict the rate of permeation through excised mucosa for the same steroid, and therefore, the PCL was not an ideal model membrane to choose for predicting the rate of permeation through excised mucosa.

It can be seen that as the solubility of the compound increases so does its permeation rate. The steroid compound can be sheltered inside the HPCD cavity, become more soluble and creating a large concentration gradient between the donor and receptor phases and thereby improving the rate of permeation.

shown in Table 2.21. The rank order of the permeability coefficients seems to follow increasing order of lipophilicity. Figure 2.23 shows the effect of molecular weight on the permeation and permeability rates through the excised mucosa of some steroids. A trend shows the permeation and permeability values decreased with increasing of the steroid molecular weight. For instance, the steroids with lower molecular weights, such as progesterone and dexamethasone (DXM), showed high permeation rates compare to those with higher molecular weights such as DXM dipropionate and DXM isonicotinate (Figure 2.23a). This finding was in agreement with reported information that demonstrated the transport of a drug molecule through living membranes is a size dependent (Ritschel, 1988).

A close agreement of the progesterone permeability coefficient through excised vaginal mucosa obtained in this study and the literature value (37.6 versus 69 x 10-5 cm/sec, respectively) was obtained (Chien, 1992). Similarly, dexamethasone and dexamethasone acetate permeability coefficient values obtained in this study showed the same order of magnitude with the literature values across a Caco-2 cells monolayers (4.4 versus 1.3 x 10-5 cm/sec for dexamethasone) (Artursson & Karlsson, 1991) or/and bovine conjunctival epithelial cells (4.4, 16.6 versus 0.1, 1.8 x 10-5 cm/sec for dexamethasone and dexamethasone acetate, respectively) (Civiale et al., 2004).

Chapter Two

Ester bond hydrolysis of dexamethasone acetate, dexamethasone isonicotinate and dexamethasone dipropionate has been observed. Dexamethasone valerate was not hydrolysed and showed a relatively good permeability coefficient through vaginal mucosa. Dexamethasone acetate existed in two forms, which are dexamethasone and dexamethasone acetate. The latter dexamethasone ester permeability was good as per dexamethasone valerate. However, both the two forms of dexamethasone acetate are active drugs.

Conclusion

The IR spectrum and DSC results were found to be in close agreement with those found in the literature for the same compounds. The solubility phase diagrams for the different steroids showed different profiles due to their different physicochemical properties. An in-vitro steroid permeation technique was developed and validated using sideby-side cells with non-biological membranes. A simple method using tools made in-house was developed to manufacture PCL membranes with defined thicknesses. The PCL membrane used for the extended study appeared very similar under the SEM to a similar unused membrane, indicating that it had retained its integrity. The permeation rate remained constant over the 7 days for which permeation was monitored, supporting visual findings of membrane integrity. The effect of temperature on the permeation rate showed a positive relationship between increased temperature and the permeation rate. Changing the pH resulted in no significant change to the permeation rate, whereas increasing cyclodextrin concentration resulted in a small increase in the rate of dexamethasone permeation. Solubility and apparent partition coefficient values of the dexamethasone analogues, progesterone, and oestradiols (in 0-12.5%HPCD at 39°C inPBS/pH5.0) were determined and found to be comparable to the available literature values. Dexamethasone analogues and progesterone could be easily permeated through PCL and excised vaginal mucosal membranes. In addition, oestradiol-17 and 93

Chapter Two

oestradiol benzoate could be also easily absorbed and permeated through PCL. Reproducible and linear permeation rates of the steroid studied were obtained from side-by side cell experiments using the PCL and excised mucosa membranes. The potential advantage of PCL as a model membrane in side-by-side cell experiments arises from the rapidity with which compounds permeate through it, resulting in the need for only short experimental times to generate sufficient data to provide a reliable estimate of the permeation rate. It is also cheap to purchase and easily fabricated in the laboratory into thin flat sheets. However, experiments conducted using dexamethasone and its analogues, oestradiol-17, oestradiol benzoate, and progesterone, suggest that PCL is not a useful model membrane since it is a poor predictor of permeation rate across (excised) vaginal mucosa. The excised mucosa was permeable to the tested steroids with some differences in degree of permeation. Bothe molecular weight and solubility of the steroid affected the rate of permeation. The rate of permeation increased with increasing the solubility of the steroid. Conversely, both rate of permeation and permeability values decreased with increasing the molecular weight of the steroid. The ester group on the carbon 21 position for dexamethasone acetate, dexamethasone isonicotinate and dexamethasone dipropionate were hydrolysed. The ester group of dexamethasone valerate did not show any hydrolysis. Dexamethasone acetate and dexamethasone valerate showed higher permeability values across vaginal mucosa compare to other tested dexamethasone analogues and therefore, they could be used for induced calving pervaginum administration.

Analytical methods
Introduction

Initially an analytical UV spectrophotometric (Spectrophotometer DU® 640, Beckman, USA) method was developed and validated for all steroids studied in this research. This analytical method was used for in vitro permeation experiments to measure steroid permeation across non-biological (140 m thick poly-caprolactone, 150 m thick silicone and 50 m thick synthetic skin) membranes as described in Chapter Two (Section 2.3.2.6). The use of the UV method was considered because it is fast, easy and inexpensive compare to HPLC. The same analytical UV method was used for the determination of dexamethasone concentration from the EMID (electronically modulated intravaginal device) using an in vitro Drug Dissolution Method as described in Chapter Four (Section 4.2.6.2) . However, it was found that using biological tissues such as excised vaginal mucosa requires sensitive analytical techniques such as HPLC to differentiate the analyte from extraneous material that may come off the membrane. Therefore, the development and validation of an HPLC method was essential. In addition, HPLC assays for progesterone, oestradiol-17 and cloprostenol stability were developed. All dosage forms of these three compounds were evaluated by assessing their chemical and physical stability and the results of this stability study are presented in Chapter Five (Section 5.3.5).

Phosphate buffer of pH 5.0 was prepared in deionised water following the procedure given by Lentner (984) from a combination of sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate 1-hydrate (66 mM NH2PO4·H2O, 9.2 g/L) and di-Sodium hydrogen orthophosphate anhydrous (66 mM N2HPO4, 9.5 g/L) 99:1 buffer ratio.

Chapter Three

Following manufacture of the buffer, 5% w/v (50 g/L) HPCD was added and dissolved using ultrasound for 30 minutes.

3.2.4

Determination of the wavelength of maximum absorbance (max)

The max of the steroids were determined by scanning (UV Spectrophotometer) a 20 g/mL solution of each steroid in 5% HPCD in PBS (pH 5.0) or deionised water/ethanol over the wavelength range 200­400 nm. From this scan, the peak of maximum absorbance was identified. In addition, the effect of buffer composition on the max for dexamethasone was also determined using various buffers to investigate the ruggedness of the UV method. The buffers with different pH were prepared using the procedure given by Lentner (984). These buffers were phosphate buffer (pH 5.0), phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1-5% HPCD in PBS (pH 5.0), 5% HPCD in PBS (pH 7.4), 10% ethanol in PBS (pH 5.0), 25% ethanol in PBS (pH 5.4), 50% ethanol in PBS (pH 5.8), 10% ethanol/0.1% gel (HPMC) in PBS (pH 5.0). Another reason why this experiment was carried out was to investigate the effect of the different buffers (in the release media) on the delivery rate of the EMID (Section 4.2.6.2) using the in vitro drug dissolution method.

3.2.5

Preparation of calibration standards

Calibration standards of the steroids were prepared from a stock solution that was prepared by accurately weighing 0.0500 g of the specific steroid in a 50 mL volumetric flask using a four decimal place analytical balance and filling up to the mark with alcohol. The mixture was subjected to ultrasound for 20 minutes until all drugs were completely dissolved. Standards were prepared by serial dilution of the stock solutions with buffer (5% HPCD PBS at pH 5.0) to make working standards between 0 and 50 g/mL. Working standards differed between different steroid analogues due to their different solubilities. 97

3.2.6

Validation of UV spectrophotometer assay

The UV assay was validated according to linearity and range, accuracy, precision and limits of quantitation using methods described by the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP, 1994).

3.2.6.1

Linearity and range

Calibrations curves of absorbance values verus concentrations were produced for each of the steroids investigated. This process was repeated to assess the accuracy and precision of the linearity and range. Linear regression of the slopes of the calibration curves was compared to determine the linearity of the working standards for each steroid. The linearity and the ranges of all steroid analogues were also determined in conjunction with accuracy and precision. A relative standard deviation (%RSD) from the true values was calculated for both lower and upper range concentrations. In order to have a suitable level of precision and accuracy, the percentage RSD for lower and upper range concentrations were chosen to be 10 and 5%, respectively. The results are reported in Table 3.6. 3.2.6.2 Accuracy

For each steroid, validation standards with three different concentrations (i.e., 4.0, 30.0 and 40.0 g/mL) were prepared and analysed in triplicate on three different days and their concentrations were calculated from the linear regression line of a standard calibration curve made on the same day. The deviation of the calculated results from their true concentrations was determined to assess the accuracy of each method. These results are reported in Table 3.6. 3.2.6.3 Precision

The precision of an analytical procedure expresses the closeness of agreement (degree of scatter) between a series of measurements obtained from multiple sampling of the same homogeneous sample under the prescribed conditions (USP, 1994). Precision may be considered at three levels: repeatability (intra-assay precision), intermediate precision (within different days) and reproducibility (between laboratories). Executing repeat absorbance readings of a single standard 98

Chapter Three

solution and determining the relative standard deviation of the results about the mean value assessed repeatability. Intermediate precision of all steroid analogues were determined in conjunction with the accuracy, linearity and ruggedness experiments from relative standard deviations data of intra-day and inter-day reproducibility of calibration standards for these parameters. These results are reported in Table 3.6.

3.2.6.4

Limit of quantitation

To determine the limit of quantification of the UV assay 1, 2 and 3 g/mL solutions of dexamethasone, its analogues and progesterone were accurately prepared in duplicate and their absorbance values determined against the blank (5% HPCD PBS at pH 5.0). The concentrations of the standards were calculated against the linear regression line of a standard calibration curve made on the same day. This procedure was performed in duplicate on three different days. In order to have a suitable level of precision and accuracy, the %bias from true values for lowest standard concentration was set to be 15% for quantitation limit of the tested steroids. These results are presented in tables of Appendix-F.

3.3

HPLC

The HPLC assay was validated by assessment of its linearity and range, accuracy, precision, limit of quantitation and limit of detection by the methods described by Ogle (Ogle, 1999).

3.3.1

HPLC System

Chromatography was performed on an HPLC system comprised as listed in Section 3.2.2. All data were assessed using Empower® software. Before any analyses were carried out, the column was equilibrated with the mobile phase until a constant temperature of 30ºC was reached. A column oven was used to control the temperature. The HPLC running conditions are as shown in Table 3.1.

3.3.2

Preparation of standard solutions for the HPLC standard curve

Initially a stock solution of a specific steroid was prepared by accurately weighing 0.0100 g of crystalline drug analogue using a four decimal place analytical balance. To the drug, 100 mL of alcohol was carefully added and made up to 100 mL volume. The mixture was subjected to ultrasound until the crystals had completely dissolved. The concentration of the resultant standard solution was 100 g/mL. Working standards of between 0.1 and 5.0 g/mL were then prepared from the stock solution by diluting with alcohol using precision pipettes. The working standard solutions were filtered using a 0.20 m membrane filter prior to HPLC analysis.

3.3.3

Calibration curves

For each steroid, the peak area of the chromatograms versus the concentrations of the standards was plotted to obtain the calibration curves. Equations of the computed regression lines and correlation coefficients were also calculated. Once 100

Chapter Three

standard curves with very good linearity and reproducibility (inter-day and intraday reproducibility) were obtained, they were used to calculate any unknown sample concentrations. A fresh standard calibration curve was made on the same day as the unknown samples were analysed.

3.3.4
3.3.4.1

HPLC validation
Linearity and range

The linearity of dexamethasone and progesterone responses were determined by analysing two sets of calibration standards (0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 g/mL) prepared and analysed on two different days and performing linear regression on the results. Analysis of standards at 0.2, 2.0 and 4.0 g/mL and comparison of their concentrations against the standard curve determined the range of workability for the method for these steroids. The linearity of dexamethasone acetate, dexamethasone valerate, dexamethasone dipropionate and dexamethasone isonicotinate was determined by analysing three sets of calibration standards (0.0, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 g/mL) and performing linear regression on the results. Analysis of standards at 0.2, 2.0 and 5.0 g/mL and comparison of their concentrations against the standard curve determined the range of workability for the method for these steroids. 3.3.4.2 Accuracy

Accuracy was determined by analysing standards at 0.2, 2.0 and 4.0 g/mL for dexamethasone and progesterone and at 0.4, 2.0 and 5.0 g/mL for the other steroids. Accuracy was established by calculating the concentrations against the standard calibration curve made on the same day and assessing the %bias of the calculated results from their true concentrations.

3.3.4.3

Precision

Precision was established by comparing the experimentally determined concentrations of replicate 0.2, 2.0 and 4.0 g/mL dexamethasone and progesterone standards against the standard curve and the relative standard 101

Chapter Three

deviations of the results about their means were determined. For the remaining steroids, standards of 0.4, 2.0 and 5.0 g/mL were used.

3.3.4.4

Limit of quantitation

The limit of quantitation was established by determining the background response of the method from multiple blank determinations, followed by analysis of standards near the detection limit. The limit of quantitation was determined using 0.1 and 0.2 g/mL for dexamethasone and progesterone and 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 g/mL for the remainder of the steroidal compounds.

HPLC stability indicating assays for progesterone, oestradiol-17 and cloprostenol

3.4.1

HPLC stability assay parameters

The progesterone HPLC stability assay was provided by DEC Manufacturing, along with recommendations for its verification (Personal communication). The chromatographic conditions for the HPLC stability assay are listed in Table 3.2.

The same HPLC system and method as described in Table 3.2 for the analysis of progesterone was used for the analysis of oestradiol-17 with the exception that 102

Chapter Three

the detection wavelength was 280 nm. In addition, the same HPLC method for progesterone described in Table 3.2 was used for cloprostenol with the following changes. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/minute. The detection wavelength was monitored at 280 nm. The mobile phase remained as 60% methanol, 40% aqueous but the aqueous phase comprised 15 mM ammonium acetate in deionised water. In addition, the run time was shortened to 10 minutes.

3.4.1.1

Verification of progesterone assay

Verification of the progesterone HPLC stability indicating assay was achieved by assessment of linearity, accuracy and precision. Data were generated from working standard solutions, prepared as described in 3.4.1.1.1., on three different days. Criteria for acceptance of the method revalidation are shown in Table 3.3.

3.4.1.1.1

Preparation of progesterone working standards for calibration curves

The working standards were manufactured by accurately weighing 0.1700, 0.1380, 0.1100, 0.0500 and 0.0030 g of progesterone crystalline powder. Each sample was transferred into a volumetric flask using a glass funnel. The sample was dissolved in an aliquot of alcohol with the aid of ultrasonification for 30 minutes. The solution was made up to 200 mL volume with ethanol. The resultant concentrations were 850, 690, 550, 250 and 15 µg/mL, respectively. The working standards were filtered using a 0.20 m membrane filter and an approx 0.40 mL 103

Chapter Three

of the filtrate was collected and transferred into 1.0 mL polyethylene snap cap vials (Waters, MA, USA) prior to analysis by HPLC. The corner of each vial cap was pierced with a small needle (Monoject®, polypropylene hub hypodermic needles, Fabrique Par, Sherwood medical, USA) prior to loading into the autosampler carousel, to prevent injection sample pressure causing irreproducible results. Calibration standards were analysed in triplicate, from the lowest to the highest concentration for all analytical runs.

3.4.1.2

Verification procedure

Mean peak areas of the analysed standards were plotted against concentration. The linearity, intercept and correlation coefficient values were determined by linear regression analysis performed on each set of calibration standards on each separate day. The accuracy of each calibration standard was determined by interpolation of the mean peak area (N=3) from the calibration curve generated for that day to determine the concentration of that standard. The percent bias was then determined using Equation 3.1. The %RSD of peak areas of triplicate injections was used to determine injection repeatability precision. A portion of the 690 µg/mL standard prepared in Section 3.4.1.1.1 was stored separately labelled as a QC standard. This solution was filtered independently and injected in triplicate to provide a further estimate of the accuracy and precision of the assay. Percent bias and injection repeatability were calculated for the QC standard following interpolation of the data from the calibration curve generated on the same day. Inter-day precision was determined by calculating the %RSD of three independent sets of working standards analysed on different days.

3.4.2

Development and validation for oestradiol-17

This method was intended to be applied to the assay of 2.5 mg oestradiol-17 tablets. The proposed sample preparation for the assay involved crushing 10 tablets and then dissolving the resulting powder in 100 mL alcohol. This would 104

Chapter Three

provide a target oestradiol-17 concentration of 250 g/mL. Experiments were conducted to define linearity, range and limit of quantitation based around the selected target concentration. In order to develop a stability indicating assay for oestradiol-17, specificity was considered essential in order to confirm the suitability of the chromatographic conditions in the presence of degradation products and/ or other interferences.

3.4.2.1

Forced degradation stress reactions in acidic, basic conditions and H2O2

Acidic, basic and peroxide alcoholic solutions were prepared. To make 2 M HCl solution, 11.25 mL of the concentrated HCL solution (Section 3.2.1) was transferred in a 1000.0 mL flask and the volume was made with alcohol. Similarly, 2% v/v H2O2 in alcohol was prepared in the same manner using 74 mL of the concentrated H2O2 in alcohol. To make 2 M alcoholic NaOH, 80 grams of NaOH granules were dissolved in 200 mL of water. Then, 20.0 mL of this solution was transferred in a 100.0 mL flask and the volume was made with alcohol. In addition, dilute stress solutions were made using their respective 2 M HCl, 2 M NaOH and 2% v/v H2O2 solutions. Forced degradation studies were performed on oestradiol-17 in the presence of acid, base and oxidative conditions. 0.5 g of oestradiol-17 crystalline powder was dissolved in either 100 mL of 0.1 or 2 M alcoholic HCl, 100 mL of 0.1 or 2 M alcoholic NaOH, or in 100 mL of 1% or 2% v/v H2O2 in alcohol in 200 mL Schott bottles at 40ºC for two hours. Samples were withdrawn at the following predetermined time points: 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 minutes. Prior to HPLC analysis, each sample was diluted with alcohol (1:9 dilution) and passed through a 0.2 m nylon filter.

3.4.2.2

Linearity, range, limit of quantitation and limit of detection

Working standard solutions were prepared as described in Section 3.4.2.2.1 and injected in duplicate from lowest to highest concentration. Mean peak areas were plotted against concentration. 105

Chapter Three

Linearity, intercept and correlation coefficient values were determined from the linear regression analysis performed on the calibration standards. Regression analysis was performed leaving out successive low level and high standards to determine an acceptable linear range. The accuracy of each calibration standard was then determined by taking the mean peak area of the duplicate injections and applying the calibration curve equation generated with the chosen linear range standards to give a theoretical concentration of the standard. Percent bias was determined by Equation 3.1.

The %RSD of peak areas of duplicate injections was used to determine injection repeatability precision. The quantitation limit was determined by the lowest concentration of oestradiol-17 that showed a quantifiable peak response on the chromatogram within 20% bias. The detection limit was determined by the lowest concentration of oestradiol-17, which produced a peak response on the chromatogram but was impossible to quantify with an acceptable precision and accuracy.

3.4.2.2.1

Preparation of oestradiol-17 working standards for calibration curves

The working standards were manufactured by accurately weighing 0.0100, 0.0200, 0.0250, 0.0300, 0.0400, 0.0500 and 0.0600g of oestradiol-17 crystalline powder using a four decimal place analytical balance. Each weighed sample was transferred carefully through a glass funnel into a 100 mL volumetric flask and dissolved in alcohol with the aid of ultrasound for 30 minutes. The solution was then made up to 100 mL with ethanol. The resultant standard concentrations were 100, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500 and 600 µg/mL, respectively. Low level standards at 1, 2, 5 and 10 µg/mL were prepared by appropriate dilution from the 500 µg/mL standard. Prior to injection onto the HPLC column, the working standards were filtered through a 0.20 m membrane filter and approximately 0.40 mL of the filtered sample was poured into 1.0 mL vials. Before each vial was loaded into the carousel from the lowest to the highest concentration standards, each corner of the snap cap was pierced with a small needle as previously described in Section 3.4.1.1.1, to prevent injection sampler pressure causing irreproducibility.

Validation of linear range of assay

Oestradiol-17 working standards of 5, 10, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 g/mL and a separate 250 g/mL QC standard were prepared as described in Section 3.4.2.2.1 on each of three separate occasions. Standards were injected in duplicate. Mean peak area was plotted against concentration and linear regression was performed to determine slope, intercept and correlation coefficient of the calibration curves. The accuracy of each calibration standard on each day was then determined by taking the mean peak area of the duplicate injections and applying the calibration curve equation generated on that day to give a theoretical concentration of the standard. Bias and injection repeatability were calculated as described in Section 3.4.2.2. Bias and injection repeatability were also calculated for a QC standard according to the calibration curve generated on each day.

3.4.3

Development and validation for cloprostenol

This method was intended to assay 100 mg amounts of a 0.75% w/w cloprostenol sodium formulation dissolved in 10 mL deionised water. From this, a target concentration of 75 g/mL was established. Experiments were conducted to define linearity, range, limit of quantitation and limit of detection based around the selected target concentration. In order to develop a stability indicating method for cloprostenol sodium, specificity was considered in order to confirm suitability of the chromatographic conditions in the presence of degradation products.

3.4.3.1

Forced degradation stress reactions in acidic, basic conditions and H2O2

Cloprostenol powder of 0.01 g was weighed and dissolved in equal volume of 100 mL of 1M HCL, 1M NaOH or 0.1%, 1% and 10% v/v H2O2 in deionised water in separate small Schott bottles. The samples were put in a dry oven at 40ºC for two hours. From each treatment, 9 samples were taken at specified time intervals for sample analysis (i.e., 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 minutes) to qualitatively investigate drug degradation. These samples were passed through a 0.20 m filter prior to analysis by HPLC. 108

3.4.3.2

Linearity, range, limit of quantitation and limit of detection

Working standard solutions were prepared as described in Section 3.4.3.2.1 and injected in duplicate from lowest to highest concentration. Mean peak areas were plotted against concentration. Linearity, intercept and correlation coefficient values were determined from the linear regression performed on the calibration standards. Regression was performed leaving out successive low and high level standards to determine an acceptable linear range. The accuracy of each calibration standard was then determined by taking the mean peak area of the duplicate injections and applying the calibration curve equation generated with the chosen linear range standards to give a theoretical concentration of the standard. The %RSD of peak areas of duplicate injections were used to determine injection repeatability precision as described in Section 3.3.4.3. Percent bias and calculated rates were then determined by the Equation 3.1 and Equation 3.2. The lowest concentration of cloprostenol produced a peak response on the chromatogram, but was impossible to quantify with acceptable precision and accuracy determined the detection limit. The quantitation limit was determined by the lowest concentration of cloprostenol sodium that showed a quantifiable peak response on the chromatogram within 20% bias.

3.4.3.2.1

Preparation of cloprostenol standard solutions for the HPLC standard curve

Stock solutions of cloprostenol were prepared by accurately weighing 0.0100, 0.0150, 0.0250, 0.0300, 0.0350 and 0.0450 g of crystalline powder in separate small weighing boats using a four decimal place analytical balance. The weighed drug was transferred through a funnel into 50 mL volumetric flasks while rinsing with deionised water carefully and made up to 50 mL. The mixture was subjected to ultrasound until the crystalline powder was completely dissolved. The theoretical concentrations of resultant standards solution were 200, 300, 500, 600, 750 and 900 g/mL, respectively. Also 5, 10 and 100 g/mL standards were manufactured from the 500 g/mL standard solution with appropriate dilutions.

In addition, the different buffer compositions or pH had no effect on max of dexamethasone. Regardless of any of the buffer systems used, the experimentally determined max of dexamethasone was remaining unchanged (242 nm). Therefore, this indicated the robustness of the wavelength used.

Concentration versus absorbance values were plotted from data for the two sets of calibration standards to make two standard curves for all steroids studied (Figure 3.1).

Accuracy and precision

The assessment of accuracy of the UV method for all steroids studied was conducted in conjunction with assessment of the precision of the method. The inter-day reproducibility of accuracy (% bias) and precision (%RSD) of the lower (4 g/mL), middle (30 g/mL) and high (40 g/mL) range is shown in Table 3.6. The accuracy (%bias) and precision (%RSD) values presented in here were calculated from an average of two replicates of the standard with the lowest accuracy and precision of the sated range.

In addition, the inter-day reproducibility of accuracy (3%bias) and precision (2.1%) of the middle and high standards were found to be very accurate and more precise than the lower range standard for the steroids studied (Appendix-E). This is because the lower standard is closer to quantitation limit than the middle and high standards. The raw data of inter-day reproducibility of accuracy and precision of the lower, middle and high ranges for each steroid is shown in tables of Appendix-E.

3.5.1.3

Quantitation limit of the UV assay

The data for quantitation limit of each steroid was determined to define the lowest concentration of the drug with acceptable accuracy and precision for the true value against the standard calibration curves. The quantitation limit of the UV assay of the steroids studied was 1, 1, 2, 2, 2 and 3g/mL for dexamethasone, dexamethasone acetate, dexamethasone isonicotinate, dexamethasone valerate, 112

Chapter Three

dexamethasone dipropionate and progesterone, respectively. The inter-day reproducibility for lowest standard concentration proved to have the %bias of 15% from true values for quantitation limit of the tested steroids. The raw data of quantitation limit of the UV assay is shown in tables of Appendix-F.

HPLC assay

A typical chromatogram for the various steroids investigated in the thesis is shown in Figure 3.2. Some peaks reflecting the solvent front (mobile phase or junk materials) were eluted out of the column before 4 minutes of HPLC analytical run time. The retention time of dexamethasone peak appeared at 6.0 minutes. All other steroids were eluting out of the column between 8 and 24 minutes due to their different lipophilicity. The steroids were analysed on the HPLC system one at time. All steroids studied showed very good peak shape and a stable baseline as shown below.

Oestradiol-17 HPLC stability indicating assays Forced degradation studies in acid, alkali and H2O2

Oestradiol-17 was stable at 40ºC for two hours in 0.1 M alcoholic HCl, 0.1 M alcoholic NaOH and 1% v/v H2O2. In addition, the compound was stable in 2M alcoholic NaOH and there was no evidence of any degradation of the product on the chromatograms. In contrast 2M alcoholic HCl and 2% v/v H2O2 induced degradation of the oestradiol-17. Degradation products were observed on the chromatograms (Figure 3.5). However, none of these degradant peak products interfered with the peak of interest. Oestradiol-17 was found to be completely unstable in 2% v/v H2O2 and the peak representing oestradiol-17 completely disappeared from the chromatogram.

Linearity, range, limit of quantitation and limit of detection

The data for linearity range, precision and accuracy of oestradiol-17 using working standards from 0 to 600 g/mL is shown in Table 3.11. In addition, this table shows the quantitation and detection limit of the tested working standards for the method. The %RSD values of working standards between 10 and 600 g/mL were 0.7% and 6.5% including 5 g/mL (Table 3.11). The lower working standards of 1 and 2 g/mL of oestradiol-17 have shown high %RSD (low precision) values of 55.8 and 15.8, respectively. In order to achieve the acceptable linear range of the assay the two lowest standards were left out.

All HPLC assays were shown to be linear within the stated range, precise and accurate (Table 3.23). The HPLC method is specific and selective. However, the HPLC is time consuming (longer analytical run time), complex (programme setups) and expensive (cost of consumables) compare to UV method.

HPLC stability indicating assays for progesterone, oestradiol17 and cloprostenol

Verification of the existing stability indicating HPLC assay for progesterone supplied by DEC Manufacturing QC Laboratory was successfully achieved (Table 3.24 ). All specification limits were met and therefore the method is revalidated. The generation of the three independent standard curves plotted using the data 129

Chapter Three

from Figure 3.4, respectively, provided data that met the predefined verification specifications. Progesterone retention time was the same between laboratories at approximately 27 minutes and the method linearity, slopes, intercepts, accuracy and precision of the 15 to 850 g/mL range were very reproducible between the DEC and InterAg laboratories. The inter-day reproducibility data of the verified method (Table 3.10) and the method precision of target concentration were excellent (1.5 %RSD, for an average of 0.2, 1.7 and 0.50%, RSD = 0.8%).

Development and validation of a stability indicating assay for oestradiol-17 was successfully achieved by adopting a slight modification to the method supplied by DEC QC Laboratory for progesterone (change of analytical wavelength). This is because oestradiol-17 absorbs at different wavelength from progesterone. A similar wavelength was used by previous researchers using HPLC stability assay methods for either oestradiol-17 or one of its analogues. Kotiyan & Vavia (2000) and Segall et al. (1999) used the analytical wavelength of 280 and 286 nm for oestradiol-17 and oestradiol valerate, respectively.

130

Chapter Three

The peak representing oestradiol-17 appeared at 28 minutes and was shown through forced stability studies to remain independent of the degradation peak. The additional peak appeared on the chromatogram of oestradiol-17 exposed to 2M HCl due to formation of degradation product as shown in Figure 3.5. This was explained by the fact that oestradiol-17 molecule is prone to dehydration in acidic conditions. For instance, in 1M HCl at 70ºC for 2 hours caused oestradiol17 degradation as it was investigated by Kotiyan & Vavia (2000). This occurs due to loss of a molecule of water on 17--hydroxyl group of oestradiol-17 to form degradation product. In the same study, oestradiol-17 was stable in basic conditions. This also is in accord with absence of any additional peak indicating decomposition of oestradiol-17 samples which were exposed in basic conditions in our study. The generation of three independent standard curves of Figure 3.7, respectively provided data that validated the method shown in Table 3.25. The specification limits were met and therefore this validates the method.

Development and validation of a stability indicating assay for cloprostenol was successfully achieved by adopting several modifications to the method supplied by DEC QC Laboratory for progesterone (change of analytical wavelength, flow rate and pH of mobile phase). Cloprostenol has different physicochemical properties from progesterone or oestradiol-17 and therefore different chromatographic conditions were required. The peak representing cloprostenol appeared at 6 minutes and was shown through forced stability studies to remain independent of degradation peaks. No additional peak, indicating degradation, appeared on the chromatograms. The generation of three independent standard curves (Figure 3.9, respectively) provided data that validated the method shown in Table 3.26. The specification limits were met and therefore this shows that the method is validated.

Conclusions

UV and HPLC analytical methods were developed and validated for in vitro permeation and Drug Dissolution Testing (UV only) experiments on the steroids studied in this research. In both methods, assays were shown to be linear within the stated range, precise and accurate. In addition, the HPLC stability assays for progesterone were revalidated and for oestradiol-17 and cloprostenol were developed and validated. All the HPLC stability assays were also shown to be linear within the stated range, precise and accurate. In addition, there were no additional peaks, which were not originally apparent, indicating no degradation interfering in the stability assays of the tested drugs.

Assessment of an electronically controlled drug delivery technology for veterinary applications

4.1

Introduction

A veterinary controlled drug delivery technology provides for dosing animals with a drug or drugs at predefined and reproducible rates, often for prolonged periods of time. These systems can provide significant benefits compared to single injection dosage forms including (Rathbone et al., 2000): · the ability to tailor or to integrate the administration of health and production oriented pharmaceuticals around the constraints of farm management systems, · · a reduction of stress to the animal by decreasing the number of times the animal is handled, financial benefits to the animal's owner resulting from reduced veterinarian cost, optimisation of employees time by reducing the time needed for herding administration, · · · · improved therapeutic outcomes, the maintenance of drug levels within a desired range, increased patient compliance, increased cost benefits to the end user.

A common means of controlling the delivery of a drug is through the use of a polymer. The drug is incorporated into either a natural or synthetic polymer matrix and is slowly released at a rate that is dependant on the physicochemical properties of both the drug and the polymer. These systems offer several advantages: · · they are cheap to manufacture, a variety of polymers are available and the release profile can therefore be tailored to meet a particular need.

134

Chapter Four

However, they also have certain disadvantages, which include: · · · · · once manufactured the release rate cannot usually be adjusted, once manufactured it is difficult to modify the duration of release, the technology is usually route specific and cannot be transferred, each technology is often developed for a specific active drug, and the polymeric system technology is often not applicable to other drugs, the release profile from simple polymeric systems declines with time, resulting in non-linear release of drug over time and declining blood profiles. Amongst the ways scientists have attempted to overcome these problems is the development of systems that use electronic devices to control the rate and duration of drug delivery. In such cases, drug delivery control resides in the electronic circuitry, and is not dependant upon the properties of the drug. Such systems offer versatility in: · · · · · adjustable release rates, adjustable durations of release, the capability of being designed for several different routes, applicability to a wide range of drugs, sustaining high blood profiles as a result of uniform and linear release of drug over time. Examples of electronically controlled devices used for farm animals include the SMARTT1® Intelligent Breeding Device (IBD) and the Electronically Modulated Intravaginal Device (EMID). Most of this thesis is concerned with the EMID. A description of SMARTT1® is provided for comparative purposes.

The SMARTT1® IBD

The SMARTT1® IBD is shown in Figure 4.1.
Head (three small reservoirs)

Figure 4.1.SMARTT1® Intelligent Breeding Device (Cross, 2002).

The IBD was developed in New Zealand for the purpose of controlling the oestrous cycle in cattle (Rathbone et al., 1998; Cross, 2002). This device comprises three main sections, an outer plastic sheath is designed to protect the inner compartment, which comprises an electronic chip and board, four drug reservoirs, a retention mechanism and a tail (Figure 4.1). The retention mechanism has an umbrella configuration shape and is located at the head of the device. The main drug reservoir is located at the bottom of the device, and contains 5 mL of a progesterone formulation. This reservoir opens directly to a small orifice at the top of the device (Cross, 2002) via a small bore stainless steel tube that opens to the exterior at the flat face. The other three reservoirs, each of which has a maximum capacity of 0.45 mL, are located near the head of the device and contain either oestradiol or prostaglandin. Tight fitting santoprene rubber seals are used to prevent drug solutions from leaking from their reservoirs during storage
136

Chapter Four

and while in the animal. There is a movable piston and spring between the main rubber seal and the bottom of the device. The remainder of the device comprises a circuit board and batteries. The circuit board contains a controlling chip, a power-on indication LED and a quartz timer (Rathbone et al., 1998; Cross, 2002). Drug release from the reservoirs is controlled electronically according to a pre-programmed electronic chip. The small orifice of the inner compartment reservoir is opened and closed by a switch mechanism that is operated by a solenoid, and drug can only leave the reservoir when the switch is in the open position. The batteries and an electronic timing system of the device control a solenoid that operates a valve, which in turn, controls the drug release slowly and continuously over a 10 day period under the influence of the spring pressurized piston. Unlike other conventional drug delivery systems that are currently on the market such as the PRID and CIDRTM-B, the IDB technology offers the advantage of incorporating multiple drugs required for oestrous control of cattle within a single device. However, because the batteries and electronics take up so much room and there is limited room available for the main reservoir, there are restrictions on the capacity of the drug reservoirs of the device. Also the nature of the spring loaded controlled orifice release mechanism is such that any small blockage could adversely affect dosage after that point and could undermine practical application of the IDB technology (Cross, 2002). Finally, the IBD has a limited volume capacity and a very complex design. Unlike the IBD technology, the EMID offers the advantage of having a large volume reservoir and a less complex design.

It is noteworthy that the final EMID arrangement has tinfoil adhered onto the outside of the body (not shown). The main reservoir of the EMID inner compartment has a 30 mL capacity and an outlet area of 0.22 cm2 whereas the secondary chambers have a total volume of 100 mL each and an individual outlet area of 1.1 cm2. Tight fitting santoprene rubber bungs seal the small chambers at the top and bottom (Figure 4.2). The progesterone formulation is dispensed from the device by a gas-producing battery located in the back of the EMID. A resistor in contact with the battery controls gas release and as the gas is produced, it accumulates and creates a pressure on the piston. The piston then moves forward and dispenses known volumes of the formulation from the main reservoir of the EMID. Part way through the process, pistons in the secondary chambers are activated by the primary piston and cause the secondary chambers to open, thereby releasing oestradiol benzoate and/ or prostaglandin.

138

Chapter Four

Similar to the IBD technology, the EMID offers the advantage of incorporating the multiple drugs that are required for oestrous control of cattle within a single device. However, in contrast to the IBD the main reservoir has a large volume enabling more scope for formulation strategy. In addition, the large outlet orifices associated with the large reservoir and secondary chambers are less susceptible to blockage as compared to the IDB technology. The EMID appears to offer the advantages that are required for the complex and demanding requirements of delivering the drugs associated with either oestrous control or induced calving. Therefore, the objective of this chapter was to critically evaluate the EMID for its application for either oestrous control or for the induction of calving.

4.1.2.2

Evaluations made during this study programme

Early in the in vivo animal work, it became apparent that there were a number of parameters of the EMID which did not maintain consistency. In particular, it appeared that many of the physical components of the EMID were prone to act differently or even to fail when placed in the vagina compared to simple in vitro air or aqueous environments. The piston was sticking in the barrel and the tinfoil was separating from the plastic resulting in a non-linear release profile. In addition, the EMID was not being retained for the full duration of the treatment and caused a high incident of vaginal damage among treated animals. These observed and unexpected failures of the technology led to the need to reinvestigate independently and in multi-factorial combinations, each component of the device (e.g. piston material, body composition, gas-cell function, and retention wings), and the properties of the payload which was to be released. Also development of an in vitro release test to correlate EMID release rates from in
vitro with in vivo rates was investigated.

The rate of release from the EMID is controlled by the rate of gas production, which was proportional to, and controlled by, the applied current (Bunt et al., 1998). The resistor is placed in series with the battery (Varta 4690 Simatec, Switzerland), thereby influencing the current (Equation 4.1.). Gas produced from the reaction 6H2O  2H2(g) + O2 (g) + 4H+ + 4OH- is a function of the amount of current and time as follows:
1Farad mol product x 96500 mol electrons

Gas produced (moles) = current (A) x time (s) x

Equation 4.1.

All EMID components were manufactured and supplied by a technical injection moulding company (Millennium Plastics, Te Rapa, Hamilton).

4.2.1

Assembly of the EMID

All EMIDs were easy to assemble (Section 4.2.1.1), although care had to be taken to follow the defined procedure. In addition, friction welding required the need to remove a very fine film of silicone lubricant that was deposited from the piston as it was pushed up to the top of the EMID to ensure a successful welding process. This was easily removed by use of a tissue and 10% toluene in ethanol. Toluene dissolves and removes the silicone lubricant.
4.2.1.1 Assembly of the EMID

To assemble the EMID the following steps were followed. 1. A thin layer of silicone lubricant (Dow Corning 360 medical fluid, 350 CST Dow Corning Corporation, Midland, USA) was applied onto the surface of each of the silicone o-rings that make up the primary piston. 2. The lubricated primary piston was inserted into the body by pushing it through the open back of the EMID and positioned at the head of the device. 3. The plug was friction welded onto the back of the body. 4. Fix the O-ring onto the plug and apply a surface coating of lubricant. 141

Chapter Four

5. Where appropriate apply tinfoil (Sellotape, New Zealand) around the outside of the body. The tinfoil is used to reduce gas diffusion through the polymer. 6. Fill the EMID with the formulation. 7. Seal the two small chambers with the secondary pistons. 8. Attach the resistor to the gas cell (Varta 4690 Simatec, Switzerland) and load into the back of the EMID. 9. Push the cap onto the plug and fix it in place by screwing it into position. The final assembled EMID is shown in Figure 4.4.

Measurement of the EMID function

For most biological applications, a test procedure is required, which monitors the release of the particular bioactive material from the device. This issue is addressed near the end of this chapter (Section 4.4), but for evaluation of the EMID, a simple mechanical means of monitoring the device performance involved the measurement of either the piston movement relative to a fixed point over time, or, the measurement of weight loss over time.

The effect of piston material type and piston design on the in vitro release rate was determined using the weight loss method. Polypropylene EMIDs covered in tinfoil containing 2% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) gel (Grade 60SH10000 USP [Shin_Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd, Chiyoda-ku, Japan]) were fitted with a resistor of 750 Ohms. Experiments were conducted at 40ºC/75%RH and the release rate was monitored for 12 days. The different piston designs are shown in Figure 4.5. Piston designs were classified into three major types which were: type A (original type, double O-ring piston), type B (solid silicone) and type C (various pistons over a polypropylene carrier).

Figure 4.6. Cumulative weight loss over time for: a) double silicone O-ring pistons b) solid silicone pistons.

Both double silicone O-ring piston (Figure 4.6a) and solid silicone (Figure 4.6b) piston materials showed a typical and anticipated release profile. In both cases, all devices performed well despite a small release variation among the devices in the case of double O-ring silicone piston. Small gas bubbles were observed in the formulation in the case of the solid silicone pistons. These gas bubbles were attributed to the presence of a possible small leakage of gas between the barrel and the piston. However, these gas bubbles were negligible, as they were not growing much in size to cause any spontaneous discharge of the formulation. Neither of the two pistons delivered the entire payload contained in the EMIDs possibly due to friction caused by the tight fit between the piston and the barrel. Figure 4.7 shows the cumulative weight loss over time of various pistons over a polypropylene carrier. These pistons were made of santoprene (a-e) and polypropylene (f) materials. The material compositions of the pistons from Figure 4.7g-l (Silicone, Reflex 123E/Elastollan WYO 1388-5, Thermoflex (65A 1800)/Hytrel 4069 and Desmopan 192) were silicone, polyurethane, polyester, polyester urethane, respectively.

All the santoprene piston materials (Figure 4.7a-e) showed slip stick phenomenon with some degree of variation among them. Slip stick behaviour produced nonzero order of release profile due to the inconsistency of piston motion within the barrel, which in turn causes inconsistency of delivery rate of the payload over time. For one device of samples represented in Figure 4.7a did not move at all due to piston sticking in the barrel (device # 2). This was checked by ensuring the pressure build up in the back chamber and tested at end of the experiment.

147

Chapter Four

From Figure 4.7b and c it can be seen that all devices functioned despite showing signs of slip stick and some release variation among them. For one device of samples represented in Figure 4.7d did not move (device # 2) despite showing weight loss (apparently due to improper sealing between the piston and the barrel, because gas was seen to move past the piston and cause spontaneous discharge of the formulation). From Figure 4.7e it can be seen that one out of the three pistons (device # 1) failed to move at all due to the piston becoming stuck. In addition, an inadequate seal between the piston and the barrel created gas leakage into the formulation chamber for one of the two working devices but this did not affect the weight loss profile. None of the three polypropylene pistons moved (Figure 4.7f), despite one of them showing a linear weight loss versus time. This piston (device # 3) showed gas leakage between the piston and the body, which caused spontaneous formulation discharge. Polypropylene carrier pistons showed the highest friction of all (due to the fact that none of the three pistons moved at all), followed by santoprene (8211-87A) + 10% polypropylene pistons. On the other hand, it can be seen that all the pistons in Figure 4.7g-l did not exhibit any slip-stick characteristics, possibly due to their less coefficient friction compared to the pistons made of either santoprene or polypropylene materials. One out of three devices performed well (device # 3) in Figure 4.7g for the silicone rubber with piston carrier. The other two had improper sealing between the piston and the barrel. Gas leakage from the back chamber went through the formulation to cause spontaneous discharging. One device became completely exhausted by day 5 (device # 2). Formulation also leaked into the back chamber near the gas cell. In Figure 4.7h all three devices for Reflex 123E piston material showed the desired profile and performed well. From Figure 4.7i it can be seen that for 148

Chapter Four

Thermoflex (65A 1-800) one out of three (device # 3) had gas leakage due to improper sealing between the piston and the barrel. This caused a slight increase of discharge of the formulation. The improper sealing was due to the piston and its carrier breaking into parts. However, two of the three pistons performed despite some release variation between them. From Figure 4.7j it was observed that for Hytrel 4069 piston two out of the three devices (devices 1 and 2) had gas leakage into the formulation due to improper sealing between the piston and the barrel. One device became completely exhausted by day 3 (device # 1) due to gas leakage from the back chamber that went through the formulation causing a dramatic spontaneous discharge. In addition, one (device # 2) out of two failed devices caused formulation leakage into the back chamber. One out of the three pistons performed well. From Figure 4.7k it was observed that for Desmopan 192 piston one (black diamond) out of three had gas leakage between the piston and the barrel due to improper sealing between them. Two out of the three pistons performed well giving very similar release profiles. From Figure 4.7l it can be seen that for Elastollan WYO 1388-5 piston all three devices performed well giving very similar release profiles compare to silicone pistons (Figure 4.6). It appears to be a very good material for this purpose. However, none of the pistons (Figure 4.7) delivered the entire payload contained in the EMIDs perhaps due gas diffusion through the body wall, resulting in progressively lower internal pressure acting on the piston (see Section 4.2.6). The total amount of the payload delivered varied among the piston materials (i.e., Thermoflex (65A 1-800) versus santoprene (8211-87A) + 10% polypropylene for 18g versus 7g) perhaps due to the coefficient frictional difference of their materials. Therefore, pistons made of santoprene or polypropylene materials were not recommended for further study due to the slip stick behaviour or high friction inheritance. Table 4.2 summarises piston performance including the presence/absence of slip-stick behaviour, function and release rate of the initial linear portion of the release profile of the tested pistons. 149

Double O-ring silicone, Elastollan WYO 1388-5 and solid silicone pistons were deemed to be amongst the best pistons tested and all performed well with a smooth release profile (no slip-stick behaviour), and allowed for a consistent rate of release (2.0 ± 0.2, 2.2 ± 0.1 and 2.0 ± 0.0 g/day, respectively) for the initial trial period. Consideration of the above results leads to the conclusion that double O-ring silicone pistons may be the preferred material and design for optimum device performance. This type had demonstrated smooth motion (no slip-stick characteristics), producing good rate of release. In addition, the double O-ring silicone pistons were in abundance compared to other materials. Therefore, further study was focused on this piston. However, it is recognised that not all possible materials and designs were tested in this study, and that there may indeed be even more beneficial combinations that could be used in future work and/or any commercial development of this product. After piston material selection (double O-ring silicone piston), the effect of resistors on the release of the EMID was investigated.

Determination of the effect of electrical resistance on in vitro release rate

4.2.3.1

Methods

The effect of electrical resistance on in vitro release rate was determined using the weight loss method. Polypropylene EMIDs covered in tinfoil containing 2% HPMC gel, were fitted with resistors of various resistances (4.7, 270, 560, 750, 1000 and 1300 Ohms). The use of the selected resistors can make possible to monitor the rate of release of the payload from the EMID between hours and weeks (Table 4.3). Experiments were conducted at 40ºC/75%RH and release rate was monitored for 25 days (4.7 Ohms for hours). The pistons used in the study were the silicone double O-ring type. Each combination of design and/or material was tested in triplicate.

4.2.3.2

Results and discussion

Figure 4.8 shows the effect of resistor values between 4.7 and 1300 Ohms on the delivery rate profile of EMIDs covered with tinfoil. Each of the curves in Figure 4.8 has a similar (hyperbolic) shape except in the case of the 4.7  resistor (the entire payload had been exhausted within 4-5 hours). Table 4.3 shows the initial slope of the delivery rate for each resistor. The main differences among the resistors are a difference in the initial slope (Table 4.3 and Figure 4.8).

Table 4.3. Effect of resistor values on the initial slope of delivery rate of the EMID (Mean±SD, n=3). Resistor value Delivery rate (g/day) 4.7  166.2 ± 6.1 270  6.3 ± 0.2 560  3.0 ± 0.4 750  2.2 ± 0.3 1000  1.6 ± 0.1 1300  1.2 ± 0.1

The final asymptote for each of the curve also varies with difference resistance values (Figure 4.8). Lower resistor lead to a cumulative rate loss profile, which tended towards linearity until a plateau is reached when the entire payload had been exhausted and the piston, has reached the end of its travel. On the other hand, a high resistance (which is expected to provide a lower rate of gas production) clearly show a much slower initial rate and more obvious curvature. What is more, 151

Chapter Four

the final asymptote corresponds to a much lower accumulated weight loss, with the piston not moving the whole length of the barrel.

The different release rates of the formulation delivery are explained by the different resistors that control the gas production rate according to Equation 4.2 (Ohm's Law).

Equation 4.2.

Where the current (I) is directly proportional to the voltage (V) and inversely proportional to the resistance (R). Given that, the total gas production from a battery should be independent of the resistance one might expect that the only difference will be in the rate of weight loss, not the absolute total loss (Cross, 2002). The clear discrepancy here suggests that in these systems, all of the gas is not always converted to payload expulsion. This in turn implies some loss of gas, either by leakage or by some other 152

Chapter Four

mechanism. Great care was taken to ensure there were no gas leaks from any source, and the most obvious explanation for gas loss is that the hydrogen being generating in the gas chamber can in fact escape via diffusing through the walls of the barrel. This phenomenon is described in more detail in section 4.2.6, but suffices to say, the rate of gas diffusion, or rate of loss of gas through the barrel, would be proportional to the exposed surface area behind the piston, and this means that the diffusion effect will become steadily more important as the size of the gas chamber increases. The only reliable way to compare the effect of resistance is to consider only the initial slopes of each of the lines in Figure 4.8 as in the early time the surface area of barrel available for diffusion is very small, and one can reasonably expect that all of the generated gas will be reflected in piston travel. Applying Equation 4.1, the reciprocal of the initial rate versus resistance was plotted to investigate if there is any correlation between the rate and the resistance. From Figure 4.9 it was found a linear relationship between the reciprocal initial linear portion of the release rate and the resistor values (R2 0.998).

The effect of body material on in vitro release rate was determined using the weight loss method. Polypropylene EMIDs with and without tinfoil covering and high density polyethylene containing 2% HPMC gel were fitted with a 750 Ohms resistor. Experiments were conducted at 40ºC/75%RH and release rate was monitored for 25 days. The piston material used in the study was the silicone double O-ring type. Each combination of design and/or material was tested in triplicate.

Chapter Four

Body material was found to influence delivery rate profile from the EMID. A near linear release rate was shown by HDPE until complete exhaustion coincident with the piston reaching the end of the barrel. The small weight change observed over the final 10 days was thought to be due to water evaporation from the residual payload remaining in the orifice housing. In contrast, both PP barrels gave non-linear and non-exhaustive release profiles, although, the one with the tinfoil coating was similar to the HDPE device than the uncoated one. It is believed (see section 4.2.6) that this phenomenon is another demonstration of gas diffusion through the body wall, resulting in progressively lower internal pressure acting on the piston and therefore a reduced delivery rate. Covering the PP body of the insert with tinfoil appears to have inhibited gas diffusion to some extent, but did not completely prevent it. Further supporting evidence of gas diffusion of leading to the having different profile release rates found from EMID fabricated from HDPE and PP polymers is shown in Table 4.4. The gas permeability was lower for HDPE than for PP polymer.

This table indicates that gas permeability values for N2, CO2 and O2 are always higher in the case of PP material compare to HDPE polymer. Based on these findings, HDPE polymer was selected as the best available body material for the EMID.

155

4.2.5

Gas diffusion

It was apparent that the EMID manufactured from PP material have non-linear and non-exhaustive release profiles possibly due to gas diffusion through the polymer. Therefore this experiment was carried out to evaluate possible of any gas diffusion through the PP EMID.

4.2.5.1

Method

In order to investigate gas diffusion through the PP EMID, experiments were conducted using two devices (active and control PP EMIDs) which were fully immersed in water. Another active device manufactured from HDPE was also made for comparison. Each active EMID (PP or HDPE) was loaded with a gas cell and a resistor (270 ). The EMIDs were inserted into three separate bottles. The three bottles were subjected to ultrasound to remove any dissolved gas in the water for 10 minutes. The bottles were placed on the bench (with lids on) and observed regularly to see any gas bubbles appearing on the surface of the EMIDs. Images were taken at appropriate times (e.g., when piston reached at the head of the EMID within seven days) to show the gas diffusion of PP EMID (Figure 4.11).

4.2.5.2

Results and discussion

There were no gas bubbles seen with either the control or the active HDPE EMID. On the other hand, the PP active EMID became covered in gas bubbles, the number of which increased over time. These gas bubbles are clearly seen in Figure 4.11. The gas bubbles observed from this experiment, together with the previous release rate profile shown by PP EMID covered with tinfoil from the previous experiment (Figure 4.10) (steeper linear release profile compare with PP no tinfoil on) provide supporting evidence of the concept of gas diffusion. Putting tinfoil on the PP EMID reduced the gas diffusion problem, in a manner not dissimilar to using other plastic materials (e.g., HDPE) which are known to be less prone to gas diffusion.

Analytical method to measure drug release from EMID

During technology development studies described in the previous sections, weight loss or piston travel measurements were the simplest and most appropriate ways to measure the drug release rate from EMID. However, any product that might result from this research will need to demonstrate compliance with a variety of pharmaceutically accepted procedures. An establishment of an in vitro drug release method is a key parameter that is used to assess in both the formulation development and quality control of a final product. The USP Apparatus 1 (basket method) and 2 (paddle method) are the most widely used by which the pharmaceutical industry monitors drug release from controlled release products. Up to this date, there has been no critical assessment of any methods to determine the release of formulation from the EMID. Therefore, a pharmaceutical acceptable test procedure using the USP paddle method was evaluated in comparison with the simple physical measure used above.

157

4.2.6.1

Preparation of formulations used in vitro drug release method

The drug/gel formulations used in the drug dissolution in vitro release method comprised a gel comprising dexamethasone (0.5 mg/mL) dissolved in 2% HPMC in a 10% v/v of ethanol/water continuous phase. The gel was prepared by dissolving 0.15 g dexamethasone in 30 mL of ethanol (SDA, Mobil, NZ). Next, 270 mL of water was added while stirring vigorously using a blade mixer. Then 6.0 g of HPMC was added slowly to the mixture and stirred for 7 to 8 hours. This formulation was used as the payload for series of EMIDs in the dissolution method.
4.2.6.2 Establishment of in vitro drug release method

The in vitro release from an electronic insert was conducted using a Hanson Dissolution Testing Apparatus (Section 3.2.2). The paddle method with some modifications was used (Figure 4.12 and Figure 4.13). The method involved a 1 litre nominal capacity flask that contained the receptor phase (500 mL of degassed 10% alcohol/pH 5.0 phosphate buffer). The 10% of the alcohol in the release media composition was to achieve sink conditions for the drug solubility. Experiments were conducted at 39ºC with the receptor phase stirred at 100 rpm using a paddle stirrer positioned 25 mm from the bottom of the flask. A specially designed lid was manufactured to hold the EMID in the same position on each run (Figure 4.12).

Chapter Four

For this study and for comparison with other measurements, all EMIDs were made with PP barrels coated with tinfoil. Prior to mounting the insert into the holder of the lid, the wings of the EMID were cut off. The outlet of the insert was initially positioned 60 mm from the bottom of the flask (fully immersed in the release medium). The final physical set-up is shown in Figure 4.13.

Sleeve

Figure 4.13. The final experimental set-up for the in vitro drug release test.

To perform a run 30 g of the dexamethasone formulation was loaded into each of six replicate PP EMIDs covered in tinfoil. A resistor (4.7 ) was used to control gas production in each. This resistor value was chosen since it resulted in full expulsion of the EMID contents within 4-5 hours, thereby ensuring the test could be completed in a working day. Initially the samples were taken over 5 hours, but then routinely taken at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 hours. This represents over 70% of the drug release from the EMID and yet avoids any complication which might result from accumulation of drug around the outlet orifice. A 1.0 mL sample was taken at each time point and analysed for drug concentration using a UV spectrophotometer monitored at 242 nm. The analytical UV method is previously described in Chapter Three (Section 3.2.3.1). For the initial 5 hour tests, the cumulative amount of drug dispensed from the EMIDs versus time was plotted between 0 and 5 hours, to examine the rate of 159

Chapter Four

release profile (slope). This showed a curved end of the release profile due to the piston reaching the end of the EMID and causing a full exhaustion of the material contained in EMID Figure 4.14.

As is clearly seen in Figure 4.14, the amount of the drug dispensed at 4 and 5 hours was very similar (13.7 ± 0.7 mg and 14.5 ± 0.3 mg) and the rate of release profile reached plateau values. This was lowering the slope values (tables of Appendix-J) and therefore, the last two sampling points (4 and 5 hours) were omitted from further work. The cumulative amount of drug dispensed from the EMIDs versus time was plotted between 0 and 3.0 hours, to determine the slope and linearity of release (R2). The mean slope of six replicates and coefficient correlation were 3.6 mg/Hour and 0.998, respectively. The rate of release of drug from the EMID can be calculated from this data, knowing the known concentration of drug in the payload. For instance, 3.6 mg of dexamethasone was dispensed in an hour from the payload of 0.5mg/mL drug 160

concentration. This indicates 7.2 mL/hour for the release rate from the EMID (e.g., the slope value divided by the drug concentration in the payload).

4.2.6.3

Effect of external and internal parameters on release rate of the EMID

The effect of stirring speed, paddle position, temperature, pH of the release media, alcohol strength and volume of the release media on drug release from the PP EMID covered in tinfoil was investigated. The vertical position of the EMID could be varied and in most cases the outlet orifice was well immersed in the release medium (Figure 4.13) but in other cases was just touching or staying outside in the release medium. In addition, the effect of the EMID outlet orifice position in the release medium was also investigated. Table 4.5 shows the variables and the values used in the study.

There are no statistically significant differences among any of the tested parameters. This indicates that the rate limiting step factor in the EMID was the 162

Chapter Four

rate of gas production (i.e., driving mechanism) which is in turn controlled by the rate of gas (oxygen and/or hydrogen) produced (see Figure 4.8) during electrolysis which is proportional to the applied current (Bunt et al., 1998). Since gas production is independent of external factors, the release rate from the insert also remains independent of external factors. The in vitro drug release method was complex and involved analytical equipment. Previously simpler methods (weight loss and piston travel) were used to measure the release rate of EMIDs. It is important to demonstrate that the simpler methods gave results consistent with the drug release method. Therefore, in addition to the
in vitro release method, four other methods were investigated.

4.3

Other in vitro release tests for EMID

The four alternative methods included assessing weight loss, weight dispensed, piston and rod travel.

4.3.1

Preparation of payload used

The formulation was the same as for the in vitro drug release method but with the exclusion of drug and alcohol content. The payload was a 2% w/v HPMC gel in water (Section 4.2.6.1).

4.3.2

Establishment of the other methods

The release rate from PP EMID's covered in tinfoil containing 4.7  resistors was monitored with each of the above methods. In each case, the EMID was loaded with 30 g of 2% HPMC gel and experiments were conducted at 40ºC/75%RH in an oven (Contherm Cooled Incubators, Contherm Scientific Ltd, New Zealand). The release of gel monitored using the different methods at selected time points (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5 hours) by measuring the cumulative weight loss (g), amount released (g), piston movement (cm) or rod travel distance (cm). The amount released or distance moved versus time (hours) was plotted and converted 163

Chapter Four

to release rate using appropriate parameters such as the payload density and physical dimensions of the EMID to determine the rate of release. For instance, to allow comparison between these four methods and in vitro drug release method, all release rates were expressed in the same units (slopes were expressed in mL/Hour). Therefore, the release rates for weight loss and weight dispensed were converted from g/hour to mL/hour by multiplying the density of the 2% HPMC gel (1.02 g/mL) whereas, for the piston travel and rod travel methods, the rates were converted from cm/hour to mL/hour by multiplying by the cross sectional area of the EMID (3.14 cm2).

4.3.2.1 4.3.2.1.1

Methods Weight loss

Weight loss involves the measurement of the weight loss of the EMID over time.
4.3.2.1.2 Piston travel

This involved the measurement of the piston position relative to a fixed point within the EMID over time. In order to evaluate piston position along the barrel a very small window was cut along the length of the EMID in the tinfoil to allow the piston to be seen without significantly compromising the gas diffusion and its travel distance measured (Figure 4.15).

Figure 4.15. PP EMID covered in tinfoil showing a window along the length of the EMID in the tinfoil to allow the piston to be seen.

Chapter Four

4.3.2.1.3

Weight dispensed

This involves regular collection and weighing of gel dispensed from the EMIDs. EMIDs were arranged to lie horizontally over the edge of collection bottles in which the dispensed gel was collected and weighed.

4.3.2.1.4

Rod travel

This involved determination of the distance of travel of a rod that had been inserted into the barrel through the release orifice and which was touching the piston. The rod was protruding through the release orifice while maintaining contact with the piston. The protruded length of the rod was measured relative to the orifice of the EMID over time.

4.3.2.2

Results and discussion

Each method gave linear (0.998) dependence of release versus time (Figure 4.16Figure 4.17) and provided similar release rate values (Table 4.7). An example of typical weight loss and weight dispensed release profile is shown in Figure 4.16. The mean slope for six replicates for each case was 6.7 and 6.5 g/hour for weight loss and weight dispensed, respectively.

These alternative release assessment methods provided similar estimates to the in
vitro drug dissolution for the release rate of the formulation from the EMID (each

method was shown to produce results that correlated well with the in vitro dissolution method) (Table 4.7).

Chapter Four

The statistical comparisons of the release rate of HPMC gel from the EMID demonstrated that there was no significant difference among the different methods used (P = 0.23) (Table 4.7). Each method provides a reliable estimate of the release rate of the EMID. The way in which the EMID works means that there is always an "initiation" period, during which the battery function is changing from gas (oxygen) consumption to gas (hydrogen) generation and also it takes a while for the gas pressure to build up to move the piston. During this time, graphs of release rate over time will exhibit some form of a lag phase (initiation phase). In order to reduce the demand on the in vitro drug dissolution apparatus, and to reduce as far as possible the numbers of samples need for further analysis, all EMIDs tested in this way were subjected to a short period of pre-observation, before being inserted in to the bath. In this case, once it was established that material was being extruded through the orifice, the excess material was wiped from the surface and the EMID place into the bath. It was at this point in time that a zero reference point was established. With all the alternative methods, zero time was taken as the point at which the gas chamber was sealed. The end result is that the in vitro drug dissolution data points clearly progress from the origin, whereas graphical data for the other methods all demonstrate a lag phase, which was ignored in the calculations. Typical example of curve showing a lag phase for the other methods is shown in Appendix-K. All five methods developed were compared in terms of ease of use, cost, time, automation capability, need for analytical equipment, reproducibility, limitations and need for consumables. The results and comparison are shown in Table 4.8.

Chapter Four

All methods provided a similar estimate for the rate of formulation release. However, in terms of operation and set-up, the in vitro drug dissolution method was relatively complex and involved expensive analytical equipment. The remaining four methods were much simpler to perform and did not involve complicated set-ups or expensive equipment. The conclusion that can be drawn from this study was that release rate determinations for the EMID did not need to be performed using the complex and expensive in vitro drug dissolution equipment. Reliable estimates of the release rate could be determined by much simpler and less expensive methods. The simplest, cheapest and easiest method proved to be weight loss (Table 4.8).

4.4

Physical characterisation of the EMID manufactured from HDPE

Although the early work of this thesis was based on the EMID manufactured from PP, observation of the PP polymer highlighted the need to replace this with an alternative plastic material. HDPE material was chosen for further study because of its lower gas diffusion properties and near linear release rate of the formulation over time (Section 4.2.5). The complete description of the EMID (e.g., retention wings and drive mechanism) manufactured from PP EMID (original insert) was previously described in Section 4.2. As well as changing the plastic, the opportunity was taken to modify the wing design shape to rounded wing tips (Figure 4.18) because the EMID manufactured from PP caused severe damage on vaginal mucosa membranes. This was attributed to abrasions caused by not having rounded end wing tips for the PP EMID. The EMID insert manufactured from HDPE was manufactured using rounded wing tips (Figure 4.18).

168

Chapter Four

Wings

To compare PP and HDPE EMIDs, the original 2% HPMC formulation was used as a payload (Section 4.3.1). Additionally, in the HDPE studies, the opportunity was taken to explore the effect of varying the HPMC concentration in the payload.

4.4.1
4.4.1.1

Methods
Retention mechanism and site safety determination

Since a different plastic (HDPE) from PP was used to make this EMID, in vivo characterisation was carried out to investigate the retention mechanism and safety at the site of administration. This involved monitoring whether the EMID remains in the animal during the length of treatment without damaging the vaginal mucosa membranes. The EMIDs were placed into the vagina of 12 cattle and monitored for 10 days. The retention rate and site safety of the EMIDs were monitored during the treatment. Cows underwent a visual inspection of the vagina on days 5 after removal of the EMIDs. If there was no damage on the mucosa, they were reinserted. On day 10, all animals underwent another visual vaginal inspection for any mucosal damage. The EMID manufactured from HDPE was retained reasonably well (at the half way of the length of the treatment) but caused a high incidence of vaginal damage (Section 4.5.2.1.1). This led to a modification of the EMID retention mechanism, which involved cutting the wings off, and attaching the EMID to a commercially 169

Chapter Four

available CIDRTM-B as shown in Figure 4.19. These resultant devices were observed in 30 cattle over 16 days.

Figure 4.19. Picture of the EMID manufactured from HDPE attached to a commercially available CIDRTM-B.

Due to a poor retention rate (Section 5.4.2.1.2) of the modified HDPE EMID strapped onto a loaded CIDRTM-B, a further modification of the EMID retention mechanism was made. This involved attaching blank PCL wings (Supplied by InterAg) to the EMID after removal of the original wings (Figure 4.20). The wings were manually attached to the EMID using epoxy resin. The retention rate and site safety of this design were tested in 12 cows for 10 days.

Chapter Four

EMIDs containing 2% HPMC gel were fitted with a 750  resistor (this resistor was expected to provide a complete release of the payload material over 10 days). The piston material used in the study was the silicone double O-ring type. Cows underwent a visual inspection of the vagina after 5 days involving removal of the EMIDs. EMIDs were reinserted into the cows after examination.

4.4.1.2

Preparation of payload formulations

Formulations of 1, 2 and 3% w/v HPMC were prepared by weighing appropriate amounts of HPMC (9, 18 and 27 g), adding slowly to 900 mL water in a beaker and leaving to be stirred for 7 to 8 hours at room temperature using a star blade mixer (Heidolph, Nicholas Watson Victor Ltd, Germany). In addition, three 4% w/v HPMC gel formulations containing 5 mg/mL, 15 mg/mL and 25 mg/mL progesterone were used in a drug release evaluation study. Each of these formulations was manufactured by first mixing a known amount of progesterone and water in a beaker using the star blade mixer and the slow addition of the HPMC until a uniform suspension product was achieved. All formulations were left to stand at room temperature for two days prior to loading EMIDs to ensure complete removal of any gas bubbles from the payload. The gas bubbles were formed during the manufacturing of the formulation.

4.4.1.3

Effect of different viscosity and different orifice size on release profiles of the EMID

It is apparent that cows move during their grazing time. They acquire different postures such as standing, running, sitting, jumping, mounting, etc. All these activities create a movement, which may disturb and shake the EMID payload and thus disturb the release profile. In addition, it is expected that the viscosity of the payload and the size of the outlet orifice of the EMID may affect the release profile. For instance, a large orifice EMID containing water (as a payload) is more likely to lose the payload compared to a high viscosity payload and small orifice EMID, when both the EMIDs are introduced by similar movements. The modified 171

Chapter Four

EMID manufactured from HDPE attached to a commercially available CIDRTM-B as shown in Figure 4.19, was used. The aim was to investigate the effect of orifice diameter and gel viscosity (%HPMC) upon in vivo release rate of the payload. Using the modified insert, in vivo release rate was determined by administering EMID's into the vaginas of cows and removing them at specified (daily) time points. Upon removal, the EMIDs were washed, dried and then weighed. In addition, the piston position was also measured. The EMID's were then re-placed into the vagina of the same cow where they remained until due for removal. In practice, the recovery times were staggered to accommodate animal welfare considerations. On removal, the EMIDs were cleaned and inspected. The inspection process included weighing and noting piston position prior to reinsertion. The EMID's were removed for analysis then re-inserted 5 times over 16 days, with all EMID's being removed on day 16. The interaction between viscosity and orifice surface area on in vivo release rate was determined. HDPE EMIDs contained either water or HPMC gel at 1, 2 or 3% and were fitted with a 1000  resistor (this resistor is expected to provide a complete release of the payload material over 15 days). Release rate was monitored for 16 days. The piston material used in this study was the silicone double O-ring type. Orifice surface areas were altered by changing the diameter of the outlet orifice of the large reservoir of the EMID (Figure 4.21). This was achieved by either removing the central cross-likes structure or inserting a sleeve into the orifice. The resultant orifice surface areas were then 0.354 (large) or 0.194 (small) cm2 compared to the original 0.22 cm2 (medium). Each of the four formulations (water, 1, 2 and 3%HPMC) were tested using these orifice sizes. All combinations were tested in duplicate for water and 3%HPMC whereas triplicate measurements were used for 1 and 2%HPMC. Any technology failures and the causes were carefully observed and recorded.

Drug release evaluation (progesterone dose titration study)

Ovariectomised (ovex), non lactating cows aged between 3 to 4 years were enrolled from a herd of 14 animals that were located at Dexcel, Hamilton, NZ. The cows weighed between 500 and 700 kg. The three formulations containing 5 mg/mL, 15 mg/mL and 25 mg/mL progesterone were used in the study. Each formulation was tested in quadruplicate EMIDs manufactured from HDPE which had attached to blank PCLwings (Figure 4.20) and containing 30 g of the formulation. This resulted in three treatments each with a total expected progesterone load of 150, 450 and 750 mg per EMID. All EMIDs were fitted with a 750  resistor. These were administered into the vagina of 12 cattle for 8 days. The progesterone plasma concentration of the treated ovex cows was monitored over time. Plasma samples were taken at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 days and 24 hours post removal. The blood samples were collected in evacuated tubes containing heparin. Plasma was separated by centrifugation (1500 x g for 15 min) and stored at or below -12oC for subsequent progesterone analysis. Concentrations of progesterone in plasma were determined by direct radioimmunoassay using a commercial solid phase I125 label (Coat-a-Count, DPC, Los Angeles, California, USA).

Results and discussion
Retention rate and safety determination of the EMID HDPE EMID

The EMID manufactured from HDPE was retained reasonably (80%) well but caused a considerable of vaginal damage. This resulted in a decision to terminate the study on day 5.

4.4.2.1.2

Modified insert strapped with CIDRTM-B

The animal experiment retention rate of the EMID was poor throughout the study period. Only 13 out of 30 EMIDs were retained throughout the study period. The poor retention was due to a number of factors, some of which might be due to mechanical complication such as increased size and weight (i.e., too bulky) of the EMID strapped with CIDRTM-B. Therefore, the second round of this study was not conducted.

4.4.2.1.3

Second modification of EMID with attached PCL wings

Retention at day 5 was 100% and all vaginal inspections found no observations to report. By day 10, four of the EMIDs had lost their tails. The EMIDs that did not lose their tails showed little reaction by day 10, of the EMIDs that had lost their tail there were minor irritations observed. Subsequently, during "drug evaluation trial", poor retention was again observed using the HDPE EMIDs attached to PCL wings. In this case, it was recognised that the wings were in a "Y" shape, not the "T" shape used previously. Only six cows retained the EMIDs during the treatment of progesterone dose titration.

174

Chapter Four

The retention rate data for each EMID over an eight day insertion period is shown in Table 4.9.

Table 4.9. The retention rate for each EMID dose in ovex cows. EMID insert dose (mg/mL) 5 15 25 Number inserted 4 4 4 Number retained 1 2 3 Retention rate 25 50 75

The lower retention rate of this trial compared to the previous experiment indicates attaching the PCL wings to the EMID was not reproducible between the sequencial trials. Some explanation of this could be some possibility due to small changes in wing orientation (changes from the original T-shape to a Y shape), leading to the EMID's beocoming dislodged from the animal. It appears that the angle of the wings to the body must be maintained close to 90º, rather than expanding to 120° as was seen with a number of the EMID's in the dose titration work.

4.4.2.2

In vivo release rates using different viscosities and orifice sizes

Only 16 EMIDs were retained in the cows for a sufficient period to collect EMID weight and piston position data for further analysis. A plot of the EMID's cumulative mass against time (Figure 4.22) shows that EMIDs followed the same trend and achieved a similar mass loss. However, the low viscosity payload EMIDs with a large or medium orifice resulted in loss of the payload material (Figure 4.22a). This loss occurred within the first 4 days of the insertion period.

Figure 4.22. Cumulative weight loss of the EMIDs during the insertion period of different viscosities and orifice sizes.

Plots of cumulative piston travel distance versus time show different sensitivities of the measuring systems compared to the weight loss method. Figure 4.23 shows most of the EMIDs followed similar trends and achieved a similar piston travel distance. The daily piston travel rate (or weight loss) was clearly not linear for the whole insertion period. The piston travel data suggests a fast initial rate, followed by a slower and possibly steady state rate. On the other hand, the weight loss data may indicate an initial lag followed by a more steady rate. The piston travel versus time profile demonstrates an independence of the outlet orifice and the viscosity of the payload on the release rate. The piston travel represents more the driving mechanism of the EMID but it cannot reflect whether the EMID lost its payload. The weight loss method may be used reliably to measure the performance of the EMIDs when low viscosity and large orifice size EMIDs are used, since, this method directly measures what contains the EMID at specified time point.

4.4.2.3 Progesterone dose titration study

Table 4.10 shows the results of the progesterone concentration in plasma at steady state for the treated cows. The progesterone concentration over time shows that each of the three doses produced different responses in the plasma profiles from the ovex cows. It was expected that higher doses would produce higher plasma progesterone responses (Table 4.10). The individual cow progesterone plasma profiles over time are presented in figures of Appendix-L.

177

Chapter Four

None of the doses showed what is known as a burst release (a characteristic of initial progesterone CIDRTM-B release profile) phenomenon. It is expected that progesterone suspension is dispensed from the EMID outlet orifice into the vaginal lumen of the cow. Then, progesterone partitions from the dispensed material into the vaginal fluids and from there into the mucosa, then the submucosa to the blood stream. The larger the area exposed to the progesterone absorption, the larger the amount of progesterone absorbed and permeated through the membrane would be. Therefore, it seems that the limiting factor of plasma progesterone levels is distribution of the suspension in the vaginal lumen solubility of progesterone. With this EMID, unlike a standard CIDRTM-B, the drug is released only at one end. Therefore, only a small area of mucosa may have been exposed to an unevenly distributed progesterone suspension. In addition, the dose with the higher concentration (25 mg/mL) would have a higher concentration gradient of progesterone between the dispensed material and the mucosa membrane in the vaginal lumen. This higher concentration would favour a high permeation of progesterone compared to lower dose progesterone (5 or 15 mg/mL). Each of the three doses showed sharp decline of progesterone plasma levels after 24 hours of EMID removal. This is explained by the short biological half-life of progesterone (Rathbone & Macmillan, 2004). 25 mg/mL doses led to plasma progesterone fluctuating between 2-5 ng/mL during the treatment except for one occasion. Any progesterone blood levels greater than 2 ng/mL can induce oestrous synchronisation among the dairy cows after the removal of the device (Rathbone et al., 1998). The EMID demonstrated a sustained release of progesterone up to 8 days. However, the retention mechanism of the EMID needs to be improved.

Stability testing
Introduction

Stability testing of all pharmaceutical products is crucial in determining their shelf lives. An active pharmaceutical ingredient must remain stable during handling, formulation, storage and administration of the drug product. The purpose of stability testing, as described by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH, 2003), is to produce evidence on how the quality of a drug product changes with time under the influence of a variety of environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and light, and enables recommended storage conditions, retest periods and shelf lives to be established. Various formulations used in the EMID, namely the progesterone suspension, oestradiol-17 tablets and a blended cloprostenol powder which have been previously developed (Bunt et al., 2001; Bunt et al., 1999; Burke et al., 1999, respectively) were manufactured and exposed to elevated temperature and humidity conditions (40°C/75%RH) for 4 weeks, during which time, the chemical and physical stability of each of the various formulations were determined. Stability-indicating assays were developed for each compound incorporated in the EMID (Section 3.4.). All dosage forms were evaluated by assessing their chemical and physical stability and the results are reported in this chapter. The analytical method should simultaneously identify and quantify the drug of interest as well as any degraded products. The appearance of any new peaks present on HPLC chromatograms, which were not originally apparent in freshly made samples were to be sought as these would reflect the presence of degradation products from the stored progesterone suspension, oestradiol-17 tablets and cloprostenol powder analysed by HPLC stability indicating assays. In addition, the effect of 40°C/75%RH on battery functionality in the EMID was assessed.

The formulation was manufactured by first mixing the progesterone and distilled water in a beaker using a star blade mixer (Heidolph, Nicholas Watson Victor Ltd, Germany) at 1000 rpm speed followed by the slow addition of HPMC until a uniform (lacking of any clear lumps in the suspension) product was achieved. The resultant formulation was left to stand at room temperature for two days to ensure complete removal of any gas bubbles from the suspension. A thin foam layer is formed at the top of the suspension due to gas bubbles moving to the top of the suspension. This layer was removed using a spatula, prior to assessment of the suspension.

5.2.1.2

Assessment of progesterone suspension

A pharmaceutical suspension is a coarse dispersion in which insoluble particles are dispersed in an aqueous medium (Attwood, 2002). A measurement of the rate of sedimentation of a suspension, the final volume or height of the sediment and ease of its redispersion are used to assess the physical stability of a suspension (Billany, 2002).

A stable suspension is one in which the final volume or height of the sediment remains constant and the dispersed drugs retain their initial form and remain uniformly distributed for at least the period between shaking the container and removing a required amount considering that progesterone suspension is a finely distributed and dispersed as insoluble powder progesterone solid particles in 4% w/w HPMC gel in distilled water. For the chemical stability study, the drug was extracted from the matrix and analysed using the validated HPLC indicating assay.

5.2.1.2.1

Drug content uniformity

5.2.1.2.1.1. Selection of extraction solvent

Drug content was quantified by HPLC after extraction of the progesterone from the suspension formulation. Three extraction solvents were investigated for their ability to extract progesterone from the suspension formulation: alcohol, methanol/water (6:4) solution and 5% HPCD in distilled water. In order to determine the ability of the different solvents to extract progesterone from the formulation, a known quantity of progesterone was added to the formulation vehicle. Spiked progesterone samples were prepared by incorporating a known amount of progesterone (0.1380 g) into 5.3820 g of formulation base. The total amount of formulation was quantitatively transferred into a 200 mL volumetric flask. The mixture was stirred using a magnetic stirrer flea (50 x 8 mm Magnetic Teflon Stirring Bar, Biolab, New Zealand) for 30 minutes. The mixture was subsequently subjected to ultrasound (Soniclean Pty. Ltd, Australia) for a further 30 minutes. The stirrer was removed and the solution was made up to 200 mL with the extraction solvent. Finally, the solution was filtered through a 0.20 m nylon filter and the filtrate injected onto the HPLC column for analysis. The efficiency of the extraction process was determined by calculating the percent bias and the percentage recovery using Equation 5.1 andEquation 5.2, respectively (where Ct and Ca are theoretical and actual concentrations, respectively) where the theoretical concentration of this extract was estimated as 690 g/mL. 181

The extraction efficiency was determined by analysis of spiked samples in triplicate for each extraction solvent.

5.2.1.2.2

Appearance

The appearance of the suspension was assessed visually by noting any changes in colour and the presence of any sedimented particles.

5.2.1.2.3

Suspension physical stability

The physical stability of the progesterone suspension was assessed by pouring 50 mL of progesterone suspension into a 50 mL graduated measuring cylinder. The suspension was vigorously mixed prior to pouring. In order to prevent evaporation of the vehicle, the measuring cylinders were covered with parafilm. The suspensions were observed for evidence of sedimentation on standing for 4 weeks at (40°C/75%RH). Sedimentation was assumed to have occurred, when after visual examination, sedimented particles were observed at the bottom of the cylinder with the subsequent appearance of clear a supernatant.

5.2.1.2.4

Manufacturing assessment

The reproducibility of the manufacturing process was assessed by examining two separate batches of product produced on the same day. In addition, the consistency of the manufactured product was also evaluated by taking samples of known weight (5.5200 g) from bulk batches of the formulation from the top, middle and bottom of that batch. These samples were analysed by HPLC as

Table 5.2 documents the oestradiol-17 tablet formulation that was subjected to stability testing.

The oestradiol-17 and excipients were accurately weighed using a four decimal place balance (Sartorius Analytical Balance, Type BP110S, Biolab Scientific Ltd, NZ). The drug and excipients (with the exception of magnesium stearate) were added to a plastic bag and blended by shaking for 10 minutes. Magnesium stearate was added and the blend mixed for a further 3 minutes, following which, tablets were manufactured using a TDP Single Punch Tablet Press (STH®, Shanghai Tianhe Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Factory, China). A sample of the blend was retained for assessment of blend uniformity. A single batch of tablets (2400 tablets) was manufactured. The tablets were separated and collected in lots of one hundred and allocated a sequential number (1 to 24). The humidity and temperature of the room environment during the manufacturing process were (62.3-65.0 %RH) and (16.5-16.8ºC) respectively. The tablets were stored in plastic bags, in a cupboard at room temperature until they were assessed.

5.2.2.2

Assessment of oestradiol-17 tablets

Like any other dosage form, tablets should meet a number of specifications regarding their chemical, physical and biological properties. Details of tests and specifications for these properties can be found in official monographs in the United States Pharmacopoeias (USP, 1994) and some of the qualities that a tablet should have include: · · · · · · the correct dose as labelled, a consistent elegant appearance, weight and size, release of drug content in a controlled and reproducible way, be free from any contaminants and micro-organisms that could cause any harm to the user/patient, sufficient mechanical strength to withstand fracture and erosion during handling, be chemically, physically and microbiologically stable during its lifetime.

The physical and chemical parameters that should be examined during characterisation testing of a normal tablet include friability, weight, thickness, hardness, disintegration, assay, drug content uniformity and tablet dissolution.

5.2.2.2.1

Drug content uniformity

A known amount (0.4500 g) of a placebo blend was spiked with a known amount of oestradiol-17 (0.0500 g) in a 10 mL test tube to produce a powder of equivalent weight to 20 tablets. This powder was then mixed for 10 minutes using a spatula. The powder blend was transferred into a 100 mL volumetric flask by rinsing the test tube with the extraction solvent (alcohol). The solution was subjected to ultrasound (Soniclean Pty. Ltd, Australia) for 40 minutes. After sonification, the solvent was made up to 100 mL with alcohol. The resultant solution was then passed through a 0.20 µm filter and analysed using the HPLC method. The theoretical concentration of the oestradiol-17 in the resultant solution was 500 µg/mL. Three replicate spiked samples were analysed on three different days. 184

Chapter Five

The same experiment was repeated using 0.2250 g of blend placebo spiked with 0.0250 g of oestradiol-17 to produce a blend of the equivalent weight of 10 tablets. The blend was subjected to the same extraction procedure as described for the 20 tablet blend. The theoretical concentration of the oestradiol-17 in the resultant solution was 250 µg/mL and once again, three replicate spiked samples were analysed on three different days. In addition, the extraction method was applied to the tablets manufactured as previously described to assess if the compaction process had any affect upon extraction efficiency. Twenty tablets of oestradiol-17 were weighed, completely crushed and subjected to the same extraction procedure described above. The theoretical concentration of the oestradiol-17 in the resultant solution was 500 µg/mL. The extraction efficiency for each experiment was calculated using Equations 5.1 and 5.2.

5.2.2.2.2

Appearance

The appearance of the tablets was assessed visually by noting any changes in the colour of the tablet and the surface morphology (e.g., smoothness, pitting). Tablets from a randomly chosen bag were evaluated to define the standard physical properties of the tablets.

5.2.2.2.3

Friability testing

Friability was determined using a Model FT440C Friability Tester with a digital counter (Key International, Inc., NJ, USA). Twenty tablets were accurately weighed and rotated for 100 drop cycles after which they were gently brushed to remove any dust from their surface and reweighed. The weight difference at the beginning and after testing was used to determine the friability of the tablets.

185

Chapter Five

5.2.2.2.4

Tablet weight, thickness, diameter and hardness testing

The weight of each tablet was measured using a four decimal place analytical balance. The thickness of each tablet was measured using digital callipers (Mitutoyo, CD-6 CS, Mitutoyo Corp, Japan). The diameter and hardness of each tablet were measured simultaneously using the Erweka tablet hardness tester (Erweka GmbH, TBH 210, Total Lab System Ltd, Germany).

5.2.2.2.5

Tablet disintegration

Tablet disintegration was determined using a QC-21 disintegration test station (Model 1620 USP disintegration baskets 65-620-001, 1000 mL glass beaker 91030-036, acrylic water bath 64-700-131, Hanson Research Corporation, CA, USA). The disintegration station was operated at a temperature of 37ºC using 800 mL of water in the glass beaker. The time taken for each lot of tablets (N=6) to disintegrate was recorded. The time of which the last tablet disintegrates and falls through the mesh was taken as the end point of the disintegration test.

5.2.2.2.6

Dissolution Testing

Dissolution testing of oestradiol-17 tablets was conducted in a sealed 200 mL glass bottle to prevent evaporation. The dissolution method was developed by taking tablets from the randomly chosen bag and assessing the effect of sampling time, receptor phase composition, shaking rate and volume of the dissolution media on the percent of drug released from a tablet. The final test parameters were selected based on the results of these experiments. Because the need of smaller volumes of the release media to dissolve 2.5 mg of the active, the widely used of compendial apparatus was not considered to conduct the dissolution testing for oestradiol-17 tablets. The final test conditions selected are listed in Table 5.3. The method involved 50 mL of 10% HPCD in pH 7.4 PBS being added to the 200 mL glass bottle and equilibrated to 39ºC. The tablet was dropped into the bottom of the bottle at time zero and dissolution was conducted in a shaking water bath (Grant Shaking Water Bath, Grant OLS 200, Grant Instruments England) at 50 strokes/minute. A sample 186

Chapter Five

of the dissolution media was taken after 30 minutes of shaking. The sample was filtered using a 0.20 m nylon filter before HPLC analysis.

5.2.2.2.7

Manufacturing assessment

The consistency of manufacturing was assessed by examining samples from each of the 24 bags of product that were separated out during manufacture. The tests performed were appearance, friability, weight, thickness, diameter, hardness, disintegration, dissolution and drug content of the oestradiol-17 tablets. The number of samples for each bag was 20 tablets for friability, weight, thickness, diameter and hardness tests. For the disintegration test there were 6 sample tablets per a bag. Every second bag had 6 tablets and every third bag had 5 tablets for the dissolution and the drug content tests, respectively. The results were used to calculate the mean value and standard deviation where appropriate.

5.2.3

Manufacture and assessment of cloprostenol powder

Thus far, a physicochemical description of cloprostenol has not previously covered in this thesis. Therefore, the following is a brief description and application of cloprostenol according to British Pharmacopoeia (1993). Cloprostenol sodium is a synthetic analogue of dinoprost (prostaglandin F2) and it is used as a luteolytic agent in veterinary medicine. Cloprostenol is an almost white amorphous hygroscopic (absorbs moisture from atmosphere) powder. Cloprostenol is freely soluble in water, ethanol (96%), and methanol; it is practically insoluble in acetone. Cloprostenol should be protected from light and moisture as described in BP (Veterinary) 1993.

Manufacture of cloprostenol powder

Table 5.4 documents the cloprostenol powder formulation that was investigated in this study.

The components of the powder formulation were accurately weighed using a four decimal place balance. The blend was prepared in a plastic bag using the following procedure. Half of the microcrystalline cellulose was blended by shaking with the active ingredient for five minutes; the balance of microcrystalline cellulose was then added to the blended mixture and was blended for a further five minutes; half of the lactose was added to the mixture and blended for a further five minutes; the balance of the lactose was then added and blended for a further five minutes; magnesium stearate was then added to the mixture and blended for three minutes.

5.2.3.2 5.2.3.2.1

Assessment of cloprostenol powder Drug content uniformity

Drug content was quantified by HPLC assay after extraction of the cloprostenol from the powder blend. Cloprostenol was extracted by dissolving a known amount (0.1 g) in 9.9 g of deionised water and subjecting the mixture to ultrasound for 40 minutes. These samples were then passed through a 0.20 m nylon filter before analysis using a validated HPLC method. Validation of the extraction method was achieved by analysis of samples derived from a spiked blend that was accurately mixed using a mortar and pestle coupled 188

Chapter Five

with a geometric dilution of the powders. This was repeated on six separate occasions with random samples being taken from the same spiked blend. Three different spiked blends were evaluated. The theoretical concentration of the cloprostenol in the resultant solution was 75 µg/mL. In each case, the extraction efficiency for each experiment was calculated using Equations 5.1 and 5.2.

5.2.3.2.2

Angle of repose

For a powder dosage form, a measurement of powder cohesion, angle of repose is used to determine flow properties of the powder (Staniforth, 2002). The angle of repose is formed by the powder poured from a container on to a horizontal surface, which makes a conical heap. This is because the particles of the powder stack until the approach angle for subsequent particles joining the stack is large enough to overcome friction and they slip and roll over other until the gravitational forces balances the interparticle forces. The sides of the conical heap formed in this way make the angle of repose with the horizontal surface. The angle of repose is a characteristic of the internal friction/cohesion of the particles. Angles of repose greater than 50º have unsatisfactory flow properties, whereas minimum angles close to 25º correspond to having very good flow properties (Staniforth, 2002). The angle of repose of the blend was determined by inverting and lifting vertically a 10 mL volumetric cylinder, which was previously filled with 10g of the powder blend, onto a petridish. This allows the powder to flow freely onto a petridish. The diameter and the height of the resultant conical heap of powder were measured to facilitate the calculation of the angle of repose () using Equation 5.3.

Appearance

The appearance of the powder was assessed visually by noting any changes in colour and any aggregation.

5.2.3.2.4

Manufacturing assessment

Manufacturing assessment was achieved by taking random samples of known weight (0.1000 g) from various regions of the bulk mixture and extracting the cloprostenol by the method described in Section 5.2.3.2.1. The extracts were then analysed by HPLC and the consistency of drug content over the batch was determined. This was performed using five replicates on three different days.

5.2.4

Manufacture of intravaginal product

EMID's (36 devices) were fabricated from HDPE material as described in Section 4.2.1 for this thesis. Progesterone suspension formulation was added to the large chamber, two oestradiol-17 tablets were placed in one of the small compartments at the head of the insert and 100 mg of cloprostenol powder was added to the other small compartment located at the head of the insert. A gas cell (Varta 4690 Simatec, Switzerland) was incorporated into the insert, but no resistor was added to activate the battery.

5.2.5

Stability assessment

A stability trial was conducted under accelerated conditions at 40ºC/75%RH using a temperature and humidity controlled oven (Contherm Digital Series, Cooled Incubator, Contherm Scientific Ltd, New Zealand). Progesterone suspension, oestradiol-17 tablets and cloprostenol powder and complete EMIDs, which loaded with associated formulations as described in (Section 5.2.4.1.), were all subjected to the stability trial conditions. All samples were stored for 4 weeks and samples were taken for analysis at time 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks.

Determination of the effect of storage on the battery

The effect of storage (accelerated conditions at 40ºC/75%RH) on the battery shelf life was tested. At end of the treatment period, a 750  resistor was placed in series with the battery, thereby influencing the current and starting the gas production as previously described in Chapter Four (Section 4.2.2.1). The rate of release of the formulation was determined by the weight loss method as previously described in Chapter Four Section 4.2.4.1. A comparison of the rates of release of EMIDs using the batteries subjected to the storage was made.

5.2.5.3

Criteria of stability testing for a veterinary product

Acceptance criteria of the mean recovery of the active drug in a veterinary product should be within the following ranges as shown in Table 5.7 (Australian Pesticides & Veterinary Medicines Authority, 2004). The sample matrix, the sample processing procedure and the analyte concentration affect the expected mean recovery.

Table 5.7. Acceptable mean recovery of active constituent of a veterinary product. % Active/impurity content 10 1 0.1-1 <0.1 Acceptable mean recovery (%) 98-102 90-120 80-120 75-125

192

Chapter Five

In this study, a deviation of greater than or equal to 10% from the labelled claim of oestradiol-17 (10%) tablets is regarded unacceptable. Progesterone (2.5%) and cloprostenol (0.75%) mean recovery should be within the ranges of 90-120% and 80-120%, respectively (Table 5.7). Stability of progesterone greater than two years old under the accelerated conditions at 40°C/75%RH was verified in previous studies on the CIDRTM-B product (Ogle, 1999). In the CIDRTM-B, progesterone is homogenously dispersed in a silicone matrix by injection moulding, at a high temperature (190ºC). Despite the high temperature, progesterone compound was very stable according to a personal communication from DEC International CIDRTM-B experts. Likewise, oestradiol-17 tablets prepared from extruded solid dispersion process in 60ºC has also been found to be a stable product (Hulsmann et al., 2000). Previously, progesterone in aqueous suspension, oestradiol-17 in a tablet formulation and cloprostenol powder blend in EMID for veterinary application have never been investigated for stability. Therefore, a validated stabilityindicating assay was used for each compound (oestradiol-17, cloprostenol and progesterone) incorporated in the EMID to asses the presence of additional peaks appearing on the HPLC chromatograms which would indicate decomposition (Section 3.4). The dosage forms were regarded as chemically stable products if the tested products retained their chemical and labelled claim as well as their original physical properties such as appearance, uniformity, suspendibility and dissolution after they were exposed to the stability trial.

Drug dissolution

Table 5.10 shows the effect of dissolution time on percentage drug release from an oestradiol-17 tablet estimated on three different occasions. The sampling points were arbitrarily selected for assessment of dissolution from the randomly selected bag. The aim was to define the time at which at least 70% of the drug content of oestradiol-17 tablet was released under the operated conditions. In order to validate the dissolution method, the experiment was repeated on three different occasions under the same conditions. This validated method was then used to test the drug dissolution profile from the tablets that were subjected to accelerated testing.

The amount of drug released is affected by the time of exposure of the tablet to the release media (Table 5.10). There is a trend of increased percentage of drug release from an oestradiol-17 tablet over time.

Table 5.11 shows the effect of receptor phase composition on the percentage of drug released from an oestradiol-17 tablet after 30 minutes of shaking at 50 spm.

The percentage of drug released from an oestradiol-17 tablet varied with different release media compositions. The 10% HPCD in PBS at pH 7.4 release media gave the highest amount released (33%) compared to other release media used (Table 5.11). Table 5.12 shows the effect of stirring rate (50 and 100 spm) on percentage of drug release from an oestradiol-17 tablet.

Table 5.12. Effect of stirring rate on percentage of drug release from an oestradiol-17 tablet. Stirring rate (spm) 50 100 % released 27 29

The stirring rate had little or no effect on the percentage of drug released from an oestradiol-17 tablet (Table 5.12). Table 5.13 shows the effect of the receptor phase volume (50 and 100 mL) on the percentage of drug released from an oestradiol-17 tablet.

Chapter Five

The receptor phase volume affected the percentage of drug release from an oestradiol-17 tablet. Increasing of the receptor phase volume possibly leads to further dilution of the amount dissolved drugs. This would be likely to underestimation of the drug concentration (close to quantitation limit) in the receptor phase. Tablets from the randomly selected bag provided an average (N=6) dissolution of 27 % drug released (Table 5.14).

There is a relatively high variation of percentage release of oestradiol-17 among tablets obtained from the randomly selected bag (Table 5.14). This inconsistency of drug release profile of the tablets from the same bag could possibly be due to the lack of precision of compressive loading applied on the tablets during manufacturing.

Manufacturing assessment of oestradiol-17 tablets
Appearance

All of the 20 tablets tested in each bag (24 bags) were white in colour and had a smooth surface. The appearance of these tablets was tested against the appearance of oestradiol-17 tablets from the randomly selected bag.

5.3.3.2

Friability test

Weight loss in all bags before and after the friability test varied between 0 and 0.6% and did not exceed 0.6% in any bag. Therefore, the friability test of all bags did not differ from the friability (0.5%) of the randomly selected bag as previously described.

5.3.3.3

Tablet weight, disintegration and hardness testing

The average weight varied between 25 and 27 mg for all oestradiol-17 tablets from all bags except bags 2, 3 and 17 (Figure 5.4). Also, the oestradiol-17 tablets (N=20) from the same bag showed a small weight variation. The percentage RSD of the oestradiol-17 tablets from all bags was smaller or equal to 3.3% except bags 2 and 3.

The average hardness for all of the tablets from the 24 different bags varied between 37.9 ± 8.4 and 57.1 ± 3.1 Newtons. Tablets within one bag also showed a variable range of hardness values. For instance, the tablets from bags 3 and 20 varied between 21 and 57 versus 52 and 59 Newtons, respectively. A pattern of hardness seems to have occurred during a manufacturing run such that after an initial drop, the hardness of the tablets appeared to gradually become harder with time (Bag 17 was regarded as an outlier). 201

Chapter Five

Since the tablets were manufactured by manually turning the press of the machine, the dwell times of the punches in the die would be different resulting in different compression characteristics, and therefore this might have caused inconsistent compressibility of the tablets reflected from their hardness. Figure 5.4 also shows the tablet disintegration results. The tablets from all bags showed variable disintegration times for the oestradiol-17 tablets from the 24 different bags (RSD of 57%). The disintegration time (minutes) of the oestradiol17 tablets in the 24 different bags varied between 3.4 and 23 minutes. Tablet disintegration appeared to vary from bag to bag throughout the manufacturing process with little or no obvious trend. The pharmaceutical reasons for changes in tablet disintegration between tablets include poor blending and incomplete mixing of the disintegrants and changes in compaction pressure (Aulton, 2002). In this study, inconsistent compressibility loading during tablet manufacturing may affect disintegration time of the tablets. The disintegration data resulted in the batch being divided into two types of tablets which are Type 1 (Bags 5-12) which were characterised by a fast disintegration with a disintegration time of less than 5 minutes and Type 2 (Bags 1-3, 13, 15, 16, 18-24) which were characterised by a slow disintegration with a disintegration time of greater than 15 minutes. A third type was also identified, which displayed an intermediate disintegration time between 5-15 minutes (Bags 4, 14 and 17) but these were not used for further study. Figure 5.5 shows the average diameter and thickness of tablets for each bag. The diameter remained constant (3.0 mm) for all oestradiol-17 tablets. This was not a surprise as the inside diameter of the die remains the same during manufacturing, the tablet diameter is also expected to be unchanged. The average thickness varied between 2.3 and 2.5 mm for all oestradiol-17 tablets in all bags except bags 1, 2, 3 and 17. Also the oestradiol-17 tablets (N=20) from the same bag showed small thickness variation. The percentage RSD value for thickness was smaller or equal to 2.8% for the oestradiol-17 tablets from all bags. It is noteworthy that the thickness trend is very similar to that for the weight of the tablets. Possibly, some 202

changes of compaction pressure of the punches were applied during production of tablets from bags 1-3 and 17.

Drug dissolution

Table 5.15 shows the results of percentage dissolution release of oestradiol-17 tablets from 12 different bags (six tablets per bag). The tablets from 12 bags showed variable percentage dissolution release of the oestradiol-17 tablets (between 22±9 and 69±11 %) from the tested bags (RSD of 57%). The oestradiol17 release of the tablets from all bags was greater or equal to 40% content except the tablets from bags of 21 and 23. Also, the oestradiol-17 tablets from within the same bag showed variable percentage dissolution release of the oestradiol-17 tablets (RSD of 7% and 43%). From Table 5.15 it can be seen that the fast disintegrating tablets from bags between 5 and 11 released at least 62% of their drug content. The slow disintegration tablets from bags between 1-3 and 11-23 released 45% or less of their drug content. The difference in percentage dissolution of oestradiol-17 tablets is probably due the different disintegration rates. For instance, the faster disintegration tablets are expected to release more drugs than the slow disintegration tablets under the same conditions. As previously explained in Section 5.3.3.3, the method of manufacture could also 203

Chapter Five

affect the disintegration times and subsequently dissolution rates of the tablets. In addition, an inadequate mixing of the tablet blend could result in non-uniform distribution of the active and therefore this may result in variable dissolution rates.

It was concluded from Table 5.15 that the drug release was not constant across all the tested bags. This was attributed to inadequate mixing used to combine all the ingredients and the likely presence of segregation of the disintegrants.

5.3.3.5

Drug content

Figure 5.6 shows the results of percentage label claim of oestradiol-17 tablets from eight different bags (five tablets per bag). The tablets from the tested bags showed similar percentage of label claim between 93 and 106.4% of the oestradiol-17 tablets. Also, the tablets from the same bag showed an acceptable deviation (RSD 10%) from the label claim of the oestradiol-17 tablets. The overall percentage label claim of the oestradiol-17 tablets is 98 ± 4% for all tested bags, which is very promising. Since, the tablets were crushed and the active ingredient was completely dissolved in the receptor phase, their drug content is expected to be recovered.

Assessment of the manufactured blend revealed that it had uniform cloprostenol content (Figure 5.7). A reproducible extraction procedure for cloprostenol was developed and validated for which drug extraction efficiency was about 80% (80±2, 83±3 and 80±4%, for the three different days) of the expected theoretical value. This lower recovery of cloprostenol was attributed to an extraction problem.

The higher standard deviation shows inconsistent drug 206

Chapter Five

content uniformity of the powder mixture. An inadequate mixing of the blend could result in non-uniform distribution of cloprostenol and therefore different samples of the blend might have different drug load and subsequently variable assay results. Proper blending and prevention of drug segregation are required for a successful manufacturing process (Wu et al., 2000). It is a fact that formulation of low dose drugs can be very challenging and problems related to content uniformity may arise. This is likely due to the use of a plastic bag to mix the powders and lower drug dose (0.75% w/w). Variability of the drug content uniformity is due to inadequate distribution of low dosage drugs in powder (Greaves, Beasley, & Swarbrick, 1999). This inadequate homogeneity encountered with compositions containing lactose is due to the migration of the potent low dose drug that disrupts to achieve even distribution of the drug through the mixing. Shaking in a plastic bag was found to be an inadequate preparation method of cloprostenol powder.

Stability assessment of progesterone suspension, oestradiol17 tablets and cloprostenol powder

5.3.5.1

Progesterone suspension

5.3.5.1.1. Appearance and progesterone suspension physical stability

The presence of any discoloration or sedimentation of the suspension was considered to indicate the physical stability of the product under operating conditions. All suspensions appeared white and did not discolour at any sample point (Table 5.5). The suspensions appeared homogeneous throughout the investigation. All suspensions remained physically stable. No sediment was observed and no supernatant occurred in any of the samples at any sample point. It was concluded that the progesterone suspension remained physically stable upon storage. This was due to the fact that the suspension contained a high concentration of suspending agent which produced a very viscous continuous phase preventing particle sedimentation.

5.3.5.2

Oestradiol-17 tablets

The previous tablet characterisation experiments elucidated that the tablet appearance, friability, weight, diameter and drug content were found to be relatively constant between different bags prior to the stability study. Disintegration time and percentage drug released varied among the bags. Two types of tables were selected, fast (Type 1) and slow disintegration (Type 2), on the basis of their disintegration time.

5.3.5.2.1

Appearance

All tablets appeared white and had a smooth surface at all sample points (Table 5.5). The appearance of the tablets did not change upon storage. There was no evidence of any surface changes implying that the elevated temperatures and humidity did not affect the visual appearance of any of the tablets.

208

Chapter Five

5.3.5.2.2

Friability

Table 5.16 shows the friability of Type 1 and 2 tablets investigated. The tablet weight loss due to the friability test is insignificant. The friability value not greater than 1.0% is acceptable (USP, 1994). Therefore, the storage conditions do not appear to affect the susceptibility of the tablets to abrasion.

Weight

Tablet weight for both Type 1 and Type 2 oestradiol-17 tablets was observed to remain constant during storage (Table 5.17). Therefore, any potential absorption of water during storage was insignificant compared to the weight of the whole tablet. Table 5.17 shows the average weight (mg) and tablet weight precision (%RSD) of Type 1(fast) and Type 2 (slow) disintegrating tablets investigated in this stability study.

Hardness

Table 5.18 shows the average hardness of Type 1 and Type 2 tablets.

Tablet hardness for both Type 1 and Type 2 oestradiol-17 tablets was observed to decrease during storage. The percentage RSD fluctuates between 8 and 12% for the tested periods. Also hardness values of Type 1 tablets differed from Type 2. Both the Type 1 and 2 tablets showed some variation among them. However, overall this data suggested that there was no significant change in the tablet hardness on storage (Table 5.18).

5.3.5.2.5

Thickness Diameter

Average thickness and diameter of Type 1 and 2 tablets investigated in the stability study did not show any difference for the same type or between the two types. Tablet thickness for both Type 1 and Type 2 oestradiol-17 tablets was observed to remain constant during storage. This indicated that if any moisture penetrating the tablets when exposed to elevate humidity conditions, did not produce any swelling and did not significantly affect the thickness of the tablet.

5.3.5.2.6

Dissolution

The effect of storage on percentage release of oestradiol-17 tablets is shown in Table 5.19 for both types of tablets. The percentage drug released appear constant with time, and drug dissolution appears independent of storage. It can be seen from Table 5.19 that the general trend is for the Type 1 tablets to have a greater percentage drug release than the Type 2 tablets (69 versus 54%). A similar trend of percentage drug release was observed from the tablets prior to stability trial. 210

Chapter Five

The overall increase of drug release from the tablets subjected to the storage may have been due to an initial reaction to the humidity that remained constant after an initial exposure. Initial exposure may have impelled some absorption of water that resulted in a reaction with one of the components of the tablet causing them to bind more strongly with time, thereby affecting the dissolution of the tablets. Table 5.20 shows the average drug content of Type 1 and 2 tablets. The average drug content varied between 91-99% and 94-104% for Type 1 and Type 2 tablets, respectively.

Cloprostenol powder Appearance

No colour changes were observed in any of the samples at any sample point.

5.3.5.3.2

Angle of repose

The angle of repose of the cloprostenol samples was determined at all four sample points. It was observed that as the storage time increased, lumps appeared in the powder. For comparison purposes, the angle of repose of the samples in the presence of the lumps and after breaking the lumps was also determined. The angle of repose at the four sampling times before and after breaking the lumps is presented in Table 5.21. The angle of repose of the clumped powder was greater than 25º at any sampling point. The declumped samples produced an acceptable angle of repose (approximately 25º).

Table 5.21. Effect of storage on the angle repose of cloprostenol powder before and after breaking the lumps. Angle of repose Clumped samples Declumped samples Difference Week one 34.1 21.8 12.3 Week two 29.8 24.8 5 Week three 45 24.8 20.2 Week four 31.2 24.8 6.4

During storage the cloprostenol powder blend did not appear to change colour, but clumps of powder developed upon storage. The angle of repose was affected by the presence of clumps that formed on storage of the powder under accelerated conditions. The angle of repose was therefore determined both before and after destroying the clumps to make the powder blend homogenous in consistency. The angle of repose was variable and few conclusions can be drawn from this data. It is expected that the release of the drug from the powder and therefore from the delivery device would be affected by its ability to flow easily and freely.

212

Chapter Five

Therefore, the ability of the drug to flow easily and freely would be expected to be affected by formation of the clumps.

Stability determinations of the whole EMID

EMIDS were successfully manufactured as previously described in Chapter Four. The complete EMID is assessed and the test procedures were described in Table 5.6 as previously described.

The progesterone average percentage labelled claim recovery is within the acceptable range of 90-110% of the expected value at any time point of the 4 weeks study (Figure 5.9). There was an initial drop in progesterone content in the 3-week sample followed by a relatively stable period for the remaining week. There was no evidence of any degradation products and no extraneous peaks were seen on the chromatogrammes suggesting that no chemical degradation had occurred due to the storage conditions (Figure 5.10).

The stability indicating assay showed no degradation products for stored progesterone samples. This is in agreement with literature which states that progesterone is very stable product (Ogle, 1999). The standard deviation of ±10 associated with samples of week 3 and 4 are possibly due to a change in the actual content of the suspension. It could be that progesterone starts to interact with polymer (HDPE) and the drug is partitioning into polymer chains or progesterone is interacting with the santoprene bung /piston material.

5.3.6.2

Oestradiol-17 tablets drug content and degradation products in the EMID

The amount recovered (%) compared to what is claimed on the label of the oestradiol-17 tablets contained within the EMID showed a slow decline upon storage (Figure 5.11). A trend shows that both Type 1 and Type 2 tablets followed the same profile of the drug content recovery in the samples of week 3 and 4. The Type 1 tablets showed a bit more pronounced decline than the Type 2 tablets with larger standard deviations. Within the EMID the tablet may absorb moisture and the drug that was in the solid state of the surface of the tablet would go into solution. The drug then may leak into the larger reservoir of the EMID from the solution or partition into the small seal rubber plastics and HDPE polymer. The 214

Chapter Five

drug from the softer tablets is more likely to dissolve than the drug from the harder tablets. It was noted that some tablets (N=2) were found to be mushy or partially dissolved during recovery of the oestradiol-17 tablets contained in the EMIDs. This probably happened when a seal between the santoprene bung and the walls of the small compartments of the EMIDs was not attained and the moisture from the larger reservoir could leak into the small compartments. This would dissolve the tablets ingredients, which could leak into the larger reservoir of the device.

The average drug recovery of oestradiol-17 from the tablets was not affected by storage with the mean recovery of oestradiol-17 remaining in the acceptable range of 90-110% of the expected value. Additionally, there was no evidence of any degradation products or any extraneous peaks seen on the chromatogrammes suggesting that no chemical degradation had occurred due to storage conditions (Figure 5.12). However, the assay value of the product proved that using oestradiol-17 tablets in EMID is feasible.

5.3.6.3 Cloprostenol drug content and degradation products in the EMID

The appearance of clumping is significant and indicates a possible adverse behaviour that could be detrimental to the EMID upon storage. It is noteworthy that recovered cloprostenol samples formed a rod shaped structure due to the shape of the small compartment of the EMID. Therefore, formation of cloprostenol powder clumps in the EMID would be expected. The mean recovery of cloprostenol remained in the acceptable range of 80-120% of the expected value (Figure 5.13).

There was a slow decrease of percentage drug content observed for cloprostenol powder in the samples stored for 3 and 4 weeks. The decrease was however, much greater in week 4 compared to week 3. However, no extraneous peaks were seen on the chromatogram suggesting that no chemical degradation had occurred (Figure 5.14).

Therefore, due to the large standard deviation associated with stored samples, the average value may not be at all significantly different to the 4 week samples. The larger standard deviation of cloprostenol was due to poor powder mixing and lower drug dosage. The average drug recovery of cloprostenol from the powder was not affected by the storage.

Effect of storage on battery functions in the EMID

All 16 gas cells worked well and showed that the gas cell was stable under the tested conditions (Table 5.22). The release rate of every individual gas cell remained the same (3 g/day) and exhibited a linear correlation of 0.996 when the cumulative weight loss was plotted against release time.

Table 5.22 shows the constant formulation release over time of all tested devices. This indicates that the battery is operating optimally and as good as fresh batteries. In this thesis (Section 4.2.4), the release rate of the fresh battery at 750  was 3 g/day for HDPE EMID. The battery function was not affected by the storage.

Conclusion

Progesterone suspension, oestradiol-17 tablets and cloprostenol powder formulations subjected to accelerated testing outside of the EMID were found to be chemically stable. There was a tendency of a slow decrease in drug content of progesterone and oestradiol-17 contained in the EMID during the last two weeks of storage. However, this was not of concern as the overall percentage of the drug recovered was within acceptable range. Different compartments of the EMID should be properly sealed to prevent any cross contamination between different formulations. The Cloprostenol powder formed some clumps, which may affect the drug flow from the powder. The battery was found to be stable upon storage.

Conclusions and recommendations for future work
Conclusions

A simple method using tools made in-house was developed to manufacture PCL membranes with defined thicknesses. An in-vitro steroid permeation technique was developed and validated using side-by-side cells with PCL membrane. Dexamethasone analogues, oestradiol-17 and oestradiol benzoate and progesterone were found to be easily absorbed and permeated through PCL. Excised mucosa was found to be permeable to the tested steroids with some differences in degree of permeation. Dexamethasone acetate, dexamethasone isonicotinate and dexamethasone dipropionate that their ester group attached on carbon position 21 were susceptible to ester hydrolysis. Dexamethasone valerate did not show any sign of hydrolysis. Progesterone followed by dexamethasone acetate and dexamethasone valerate showed higher permeability coefficients through vaginal mucosa compared to other dexamethasone analogues. Both the steroid molecular weight and solubility affected the rate of permeation. The permeation rate increased with increasing the solubility of a specific steroid. Conversely, the rate of the permeation and permeability coefficients decreased with increasing the molecular weight of the steroid. The permeation rate data generated using the selected PCL model membrane could not predict the permeation rate of selected steroids across excised vaginal mucosa in side-by-side cells. However, the use of the PCL membrane might assist in allowing for discrimination among steroids dosage forms. UV and HPLC analytical methods were developed and validated for characterising the tested steroids. In both methods, assays were shown to be linear within the stated range, precise and accurate. In addition, the HPLC stability indicating assays for progesterone, oestradiol-17 and cloprostenol were developed and validated. All the assays of HPLC stability assays were also shown to be linear within the stated range, precise and accurate. Progesterone suspension, oestradiol-17 tablets and cloprostenol powder formulations were successfully 219

manufactured and tested. Extraction solvents were developed for their ability to extract progesterone from the suspending agent, oestradiol-17 from the tablet matrix and cloprostenol from blended powder. Weight loss was found to be the simplest, cheapest and easiest method to measure the release rate from the EMID. The body and piston materials were found to influence delivery rate profile from the EMID. A high density polyethylene polymer was identified as the most ideal body material for the insert. Likewise, double O-ring silicone, Elastollan WYO 1388-5 and solid silicone pistons were found to be amongst the best pistons tested, as they did not show any slip-stick behaviour and demonstrated a consistent rate of release for the initial trial period. The santoprene piston materials showed slip stick phenomenon with some degree of variation amongst them. Polypropylene carrier pistons showed the highest friction of all, followed by santoprene. Both santoprene and polypropylene materials showed a very poor performance. In addition, the viscosity of the payload and orifice size was found to influence delivery rate profile from the EMID. The low viscosity payload with a large or medium orifice EMID resulted in loss of the payload material and thus disturbs the release profile. The EMID can provide adjustable or versatile drug release profiles. The rate of release of the formulation from the EMID can be modified by controlling the rate of the gas production from the gas cell. Additionally, different drug concentrations in the formulation can produce different responses in the blood profiles. The EMID product including the battery and associated formulations was found to be stable upon storage.The EMID (manufactured from high density polyethylene polymer) produced a good response of blood profile from cows, which were treated with the complete EMID containing formulated progesterone, but it showed a low retention rate. Once the retention mechanism for the EMID is improved, the device would have potential for commercial application in induced calving and oestrous control of cattle via the intravaginal route.

Recommendations for future work

The EMID needs further improvement of its retention mechanism in order to stay in the animal. Not all possible materials and designs were tested in this research, and there may indeed be even more beneficial combinations of various components, construction materials and configurations of EMID that could be used in future work and/or any commercial development of this product. Further research is needed to find a lower gas permeability polymer than HDPE to get a more linear release profile for long periods of time, and to do further testing of Elastollan WYO 1388-5 and solid silicone pistons with different body materials. A low viscosity payload with a large or medium orifice should not be used for animal trials as this resulted in loss of the payload material. Different compartments of the EMID should be properly sealed to prevent any cross contamination between different formulations. It is recommended that further animal trials are conducted using dexamethasone acetate formulation or dexamethasone valerate loaded into EMID for induced calving per vaginum administration. Also, it is recommended to screen flux of dexamethasone acetate or valerate (in suspension perhaps in 4% HPMC) through excised membrane using side-by-side cells. In addition, the same formulations could be administered into animals to produce drug blood responses and to investigate if there is an in vitro and in vivo correlation for the recommended steroids. This could lead a finding of an inexpensive in vitro system simulating and mimicking the barrier function of diffusion conditions in animals. Further work for the EMID might be measuring pulsing precision of the secondary pistons to monitor the release of oestradiol-17 and cloprostenol together with progesterone for oestrous control to ensure that the EMID performs an immediate release of oestradiol, a sustained release of progesterone and a delayed release of a PGF at the appropriate times. The EMID could also be explored for use as an intraruminal drug delivery system for livestock animals as the device would be expected to be retained in a closed volume. 221
