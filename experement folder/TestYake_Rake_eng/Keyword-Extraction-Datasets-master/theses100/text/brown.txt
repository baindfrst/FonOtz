Abstract
The equilibrium of aqueous D-glucaric acid was investigated via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The NMR spectra of all four species (D-glucaric acid, D-glucaro-1,4-lactone, D-glucaro-6,3- lactone and D-glucaro1,4;6,3-lactone) were assigned. A 1H NMR spectroscopy method was developed to investigate the kinetics of equilibration of the starting species (D-glucaro-1,4-lactone and D-glucaro-1,4;6,3dilactone). The equilibration was investigated under neutral conditions as well as conditions with increasing acidity. Each experiment set contained 50-100 1HNMR spectroscopy experiments that were run on the same sample using a program that built in delays. Dimethyl sulfoxide was used as an internal standard, and its signal size was used as a scale to report the changes in relative concentration of the four species throughout the experiment sets. Under neutral conditions D-glucaro-1,4-lactone is relatively stable against equilibration, while D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone is not. Under acidic conditions both compounds equilibrate within approximately 30,000 seconds. After equilibration under acidic conditions D-glucaric acid is the dominant species, while the relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone is slightly higher than that of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone. The relative equilibrium concentration of Dglucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone is low. A mechanism for the equilibration of aqueous D-glucaric acid was proposed and equilibrium constants and estimates of rate constants were derived from the experimental data. These rate constants were used in MATLAB simulations that were compared to the experimental data. MATLAB simulations were used to alter the rate constants to improve the fits between experimental data and simulated data.

Acknowledgements
I would like to express my extreme gratitude to my supervisor Dr. Merilyn Manley-Harris. Her professional support and continued friendship throughout this project has been awesome. Few students are fortunate enough to have a supervisor who has enough faith in them to allow them to work independently, yet is always available with helpful advice and guidance. It is little wonder why Merilyn has so many students. I am very grateful to Professor Donald Kiely who not only has provided generous funding for this project, but also has spent many years producing the high quality research that has provided the background to this project. His experience and expertise in the field of carbohydrate chemistry is inspiring. Without the assistance of Professor Richard Field the simulation work would not have been possible. His enthusiasm and ever-lasting patience, combined with his expertise, not only made the kinetic analysis work achievable but it also made it enjoyable. Thank you to everyone in the chemistry department at The University of Waikato. Thanks especially to Professor Alistair Wilkins for his willingness to share his expertise and enthusiasm on all things NMR. It has been greatly appreciated. Thanks to the rest of the staff and students for providing friendly faces, and constant sources of advice and conversation. Thanks especially to those in E3.14; I think that we will go down as the coolest lab in history. I would like to thank my parents and family for their love and support throughout the last two years. Thanks to my friends and flatmates for helping me keep my sanity and providing never-ending encouragement. You have made the last two years a lot easier.

Chapter One - Introduction

1.1 D-Glucaric Acid
Aldaric acids are aldoses that have had both terminal groups oxidised to form a polyhydroxy dicarboxylic acid.
D-glucaric

acid

[(2R,3S,4S,5S)-

tetrahydroxyhexanedioic acid] (previously called saccharic acid) is formed via the oxidation of the common aldose sugar D-glucose. D-Glucose is the most abundant sugar found in nature, plays a central role in biochemistry and is a building unit of starch, cellulose, sucrose and lactose1,2. The main source of Dglucose on a commercial scale is the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch3.

1.1.2 History and Production
D-Glucaric acid was first isolated as its acid potassium salt by Sohst and Tollens

in 1888, via the nitric acid oxidation of D-glucose4. The acid potassium salt can be readily converted to a calcium salt, which upon treatment yields (in solution)
D-glucaric acid . Crystallisation of this solution gave what Sohst and Tollens
5

termed

"saccharolactone"4.

Rehorst

and

Scholz

reported

that

this

"saccharolactone" was D-glucaro-6,3-monolactone6. However work by Smith et al. elucidated this "saccharolactone" to be a mixture of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone and
D-glucaro-1,4-lactone
5, 7-9

. Smith also reported the existence of two D-glucaro-

dilactones that reduced Fehling's solution7. It is now known that these "two" dilactones are actually the same compound ­ D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone, and can be formed from either monolactone10, 11. Aqueous D-glucaric acid exists in an equilibrium of the acyclic compound, the two monolactones (D-glucaro-1,4- and
D-glucaro-6,3-lactone) and the dilactone (D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone) .
12

Today D-Glucaric acid is usually made by the oxidation of D-glucose, molasses, or starch. However starch, particularly corn starch, has the combination of favourable chemical structure, availability and low cost to make it an auspicious feedstock for conversion, and it is the most important raw material for the

Chapter One - Introduction

2

production of D-glucaric acid3, 13,14. The common oxidation process utilises nitric acid as the oxidant15. This is the same oxidant used by Sohst and Tollens, and is also the method that Emil Fischer used in the late 1800s when aldaric acids were used to help confirm the relative configurations of the naturally occurring Daldoses16. Nitric acid appears to be one of the few oxidants that is able to oxidise both termini of aldoses, yet leave the secondary hydroxyl groups unchanged. This method is also very selective, and regularly yields the analogous aldaric acid as the main product1,
13,14,17

. Other methods of producing D-glucaric acid
18

include the use of precious metal (Pt, Rh, Ru)3,

, hypohalites and 4-

acetylamino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy(4-AcNH-TEMPO)19, chlorine, bromine2, and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of iron salts20 catalysts. Production of D-glucaric acid via the electrocatalytic oxidation of D-gluconic acid has been described 21. An Aspergillus niger strain has the ability to convert
D-glucose to D-glucaric acid . However, the nitric acid method represents the
22

most economically favourable procedure due to the low cost of the oxidant. Commercially acyclic D-glucaric acid is only available as one of its salts. These include monopotassium23, dipotassium24 and calcium D-glucarate. Crystalline Dglucaro-1,4-lactone, D-glucaro-6,3-lactone (not in New Zealand) and D-glucaro1,4;6,3-dilactone are commercially available.
D-glucaric acid is naturally found in many fruits and vegetables especially

oranges, apples, grapefruit and cruciferous vegetables13.

1.1.3 Uses of D-Glucaric Acid Given its straightforward manufacture and the low cost of D-glucose as a direct precursor, the full potential of D-glucaric acid has not yet been exploited. Most of the applications of D-glucaric acid involve consumption of this compound on relatively small scale, and therefore do not make use of the prospective economy of scale associated with its precursor D-glucose14. However the range of uses of
D-glucaric acid is extremely diverse. All forms of D-glucaric acid are normal

human metabolites involved in the metabolism of D-glucuronic acid12, 14. This has led to their use in medical and cosmetic preparations, with particular focus on

Chapter One - Introduction natural cancer treatments and preventatives
25-29

3

, but also in a wide variety of

formulations to treat and prevent conditions ranging from hair loss to heart disease30-45. D-Glucaric acid is also used in industrial processes 46-51, especially as an additive or builder52-62. The range of miscellaneous uses of D-glucaric acid and its derivatives reported in literature is virtually endless. From an energycontaining treatment for plants exposed to pesticides63, to a low-sugar and lowflour base for food products64 and a composition for cleaning egg shells65, the use of D-glucaric acid is extremely widespread through many areas.

1.1.4 Physical Properties The crystal structure of monopotassium D-glucarate was determined by X-ray analysis66. The crystals were monoclinic space group P21, Z = 2, Dx = 1.807 g/cm3, with cell dimensions a = 8.55, b = 10.9, c = 4.85 Å and  = 90.0°. All final structure parameters were reported (Table 1.1). Kiely et. al. reported the crystal structures of N,N'-dimethyl-D-glucaramide, dipotassium D-glucarate and sodium potassium D-glucarate as part of work analysing the conformations of D-glucaric acid derivatives. It was found that the crystal structures of these molecules as well that of the monopotassium salt reported above, corresponded within one kcal/mol of the global minimums derived via MM3(96) conformational analysis24. The conformations of D-glucaric acid and its lactones in solution were investigated by NMR spectroscopy12. D-glucaro-1,4-lactone was found to exist in a conformational equilibrium between 3E(D) and E3(D) with the OH-5 group tending to occupy the position over the lactone ring in the favoured E3(D),gg conformation. An explanation of the symbolism is contained in appendix one. Data for D-glucaro-6,3-lactone indicated that E4(D)gt conformation was favoured with virtually none of the 4E(D) conformer present (Table 1.2). D-glucaro1,4;6,3-dilactone was found to favour the dienvelope conformation of 3E:E4(D), which retains the E4(D) conformation of the 6,3-lactone ring but adopts the 3E(D) conformation for the 1,4-lactone ring.

The coupling constants of D-glucaric acid suggested conformational mixing involving the 3G+ and 2G- sickle forms, together with the planar (P), zigzag conformation12. The suggested conformations for D-glucaric acid are similar to those reported for D-gluconic acid12. Crystalline D-glucaro-1,4-lactone monohydrate has the E3 lactone-ring confirmation, with a small distortion of the ring to 3T2. Calculations of nonbonding repulsion energy show that this conformation corresponds to an energy minimum, although comparable minima can also be obtained with the ring in the alternative 3E conformation67.

14, 68

. Crystalline D-glucaric acid has

never been isolated, instead D-glucaric acid is readily isolated as one of its monolactones (1,4- or 6,3-) or as its 1,4;6,3-diactone (Figure 1.1)1, 12-14, 17.

1.2.1 Equilibrium in D-Glucaric Acid In aqueous solution D-glucaric acid exists primarily in the acyclic form and its two monolactones10-12. The rapid mutarotation of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone compared to its D-mannaro- counterpart is due to the instability of the 1,4-lactone ring (-lactone ring) in aqueous solution, compared with the two -lactone rings in D-mannaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone10. Paper chromatography was used to investigate the equilibrium of D-glucaric acid under different conditions including increased temperatures and in the presence of cation ion exchange resin11. Results indicated that D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone

Chapter One - Introduction

6

was only detectable at elevated temperatures (70°C) and that the resin accelerated the formation of the equilibrium. Experiments starting with each of the monolactones separately and tracking the disappearance of the starting monolactone and the formation of the other monolactone, found that the amount of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone was higher (by 5-10%) at equilibrium than the corresponding 1,4-lactone. It was concluded that reciprocal transformation between monolactones was via the acyclic D-glucaric acid, not the dilactone, as the acid was detected whereas the dilactone was not11. Although Horton et. al.'s work focussed more on the confirmations of the species present in the equilibrium of D-glucaric acid, it was noted that D-glucaric acid lactonises spontaneously to give D-glucaro-6,3-lactone as the first product while
D-glucaro-1,4-lactone forms more slowly in neutral conditions .

1.3 Use of NMR Spectroscopy for Kinetics of Carbohydrates
NMR spectroscopy is a rather under utilised technique for the study of the kinetics of carbohydrates with only four reported examples in the literature that explicitly use NMR spectroscopy to gain rate constants, and all of these using 13C NMR spectroscopy. The oxygen-18 isotope effect in
13

C NMR spectroscopy has been used to

investigate the kinetics of oxygen exchange at the anomeric carbon of D-glucose and D-erythrose. The results produced a similar rate constant for the pseudo first order exchange of both the  and the  anomers of D-glucose as a previous chemical conversion-mass spectrometry experiment, and also provided new corresponding rate constants for D-erythose69. The kinetics of the jack bean alpha-mannosidase digestion of various alpha-Dmannopyranosyl linkages in hen ovalbumin glycopeptides was followed via 13C NMR spectroscopy. It was found that
13

C NMR spectroscopy was a practical

method for both following the kinetics of this enzymatic digestion, and determining the structures of the products of partial digestions70. Incorporation of a allowed

the cross-polarisation kinetics and mobility of polysaccharides within primary cell walls from Citrus (orange) mesocarp. Using C CP-MAS spectrometry it was possible to gain a considerable amount of motional information even though Citrus (orange) mesocarp represents complex and chemically diverse materials72. Although actual rate constants were not elucidated, the use of 1H NMR spectroscopy to investigate the mechanism of the formation of polyamides by

Chapter One - Introduction

aminolysis of D-glucaric acid esters allowed the comparison of the rates of two different reaction pathways73.

1.4 Polymers
It is difficult to imagine life without polymers. These materials encompass human existence in the 21st century. From throwaway packaging to artificial hearts, polymers have become essential to life as we know it. If metals and inorganic compounds are disregarded, then practically everything else in the world is polymeric74. However with fossil fuel stocks diminishing, and global warming and pollution dominant global issues, traditional polymers can no longer be viewed as viable commodities for the long-term future.

1.5 Nylon
Nylon is the generic name for the linear saturated polyamides that feature prominently in the world polymer market. In fact during the 1990s Nylon 6,6 alone made up 4% of total polymer production in the United States of America75. Nylons are the product of the condensation polymerisation of difunctional acids with difunctional amines. Each type of nylon is characterised via a numbering system that describes the number of carbon atoms in the monomeric dicarboxylic acid, and the number of carbon atoms in the monomeric diamine76. For example, nylon 6,6 is formed from the monomers hexamethylene diamine and adipic acid (Figure 1.2). However, nylons based on -amino acids only contain one numeral in their name. The six carbon monomer of nylon 6 is the cyclic amide of aminohexanoic acid (aminocaproic acid), caprolactam (6-hexanolactam)75, via a ring-opening polymerisation rather than a condensation reaction76, 78.

Figure1.2 Production of nylon 6,6 from hexamethylene diamine and adipic acid79

1.5.1 Development of Nylons Development of nylons began in 1928 when Wallace Hume Carothers was employed by Du Pont de Nemours in America to initiate a program of fundamental scientific research76. Carothers' employment came soon after Staudinger80 proposed his theory that the materials that are today referred to as polymers, were actually macromolecules. Carothers set about trying to prove the existence of such macromolecules by initially studying the condensation of alcohols and acids, such as ethanol and acetic acid, to give esters. He then, took the step that seems simple in hindsight, but at that time was very intuitive, and used dicarboxylic acids and dialcohols (glycols) to produce polyesters76. Optimisation of Carothers' method allowed "superpolyesters" (polyesters with molecular weights above 10,000) to be produced. These aliphatic polyesters were tough, opaque solids that melted at moderate temperatures to form clear, viscous liquids. Although filaments could be pulled from the liquid and these filaments drawn into strong fibres, the low melting points (below 100°C), and the fact that they were sensitive to water and soluble in dry cleaning solvent rendered them inappropriate for textile fibres76-78. Carothers and his group turned their attention to the chemically analogous polyamides, synthesised from diacids and diamines76, 78. Carothers examined a wide range of amino acids, diamines and dicarboxylic acids and found that, due to the substantial hydrogen bonding via the N-H groups, it was possible to produce polymers with higher melting points than their polyester counterparts77,
78

. The biggest breakthrough in Carothers'

work came in 1935 when nylon 6,6 was created. Although Carothers believed

Chapter One - Introduction

10

that nylon 5,10 was the most suitable nylon for forming fibres, the monomers used in nylon 6,6 (hexamethylene diamine and adipic acid) meant that nylon 6,6 proved to be a more convenient and economic choice, and this was the nylon chosen by Du Pont for production76.

Nylon 6,6 has excellent properties for use as a textile fibre. It has a high melting point (around 265°C) and is insoluble in most solvents. It can also be drawn into fibres that have tenacity and elasticity78. In 1939 nylon 6,6 stockings were first sold to the Du Pont employees in Wilmington only, until enough of this new polymer could be made. May 15 1940 marked the release of nylon stockings to the rest of America. Demand was so immense that in New York alone, four million pairs were sold in the first few hours76. The commercial success of nylon sparked a search for analogues that were not covered by Du Pont patents. The result was the development of the isomeric nylon 6 by I. G. Farben Industrie77.

1.5.2 Production of Nylons As stated above both nylon 6,6 and nylon require 6-carbon monomers. The cheapest 6-carbon feedstock is benzene from the BTX fraction of oil. This is catalytically hydrogenated to cyclohexane. For nylon 6,6 the cyclohexane is oxidised to a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone, which are then both oxidised to adipic acid. Hexamethylene diamine is formed from adipic acid via the dinitrile77, 78. Sebacic acid (for nylon 6,10) is produced from either castor oil or electrochemically from adipic acid. Although nylon 6 is formed from caprolactam, which is the cyclic amide of -aminohexanoic acid, the lactam does not need to be prepared from the amino acid77. In fact the usual commercial process sees cyclohexane inexpensively converted to cyclohexanone oxime (via cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone). The caprolactam is produced from the oxime via the acid-catalysed Beckmann rearrangement77, 81.

A 1:1 ratio of monomers is essential for producing nylon with a high relative mass. In the case of nylon 6,6 the achievement of this stoichiometric balance is simplified by the predisposition of hexamethylene diamine and adipic acid to

Chapter One - Introduction

11

form a 1:1 salt, which can be easily isolated due to its low solubility in methanol. This salt is filtered from the boiling methanolic solution and dissolved in water. The solution is heated to 270-280°C at 250 psi for three to four hours. Acetic acid (0.5-1 mol%) is added as a cheap monofunctional end-capper to prevent excessive viscosity. Acetic acid is a monofunctional acid, therefore when it reacts with an amino group the chain is terminated. Nitrogen is used to extrude the nylon into ribbons as the presence of oxygen causes yellow discolouration. This ribbon is subsequently cut into cubes for plastic grade materials or meltspun for fibre use77, 78.

1.6 Hydroxylated Nylons
Much of everyday life depends on nylon and other synthetic polymers. However traditional polymers have two major drawbacks ­ their production relies heavily on petroleum resources and they are largely non-biodegradable. Rising fuel prices due to diminishing oil stocks will ultimately see petroleum become a nonviable feedstock before supplies run out completely. Therefore petroleum-based polymers can no longer be viewed as feasible products for the future. An alternative has to be found and significant research has gone into producing polymers that are biodegradable and that are based on monomers that are from renewable sources.

Carbohydrates are ubiquitous in life. They are found throughout the animal kingdoms and represent 75% of the dry weight of the plant world74. This makes them ideal candidates for a renewable chemical feedstock. As carbohydrates themselves are biodegradable, it would be sensible to hypothesize that any products encompassing carbohydrates may also exhibit biodegradable properties. Another favourable characteristic of carbohydrates is the great stereochemical diversity that even just the monosaccharides provide. This means that there are a large number of different properties available74. A notable amount of research in utilising carbohydrates has gone into the development and optimisation of polyhydroxypolyamides (PHPAs) ("hydroxylated nylons"). These are synthetic polyamides that are produced from aldaric acids and primary diamines73. The

Chapter One - Introduction

12

structure of PHPAs is very similar to that of nylon (Figure 1.3). If the dibasic acid of nylon is replaced with aldaric acid, and this is polycondensed with a diamine, a PHPA results.

1.6.1 Development of Polyhydroxypolyamides Incorporating carbohydrates into potentially commercially successful polyamides requires development of a method that overcomes the numerous protection/deprotection steps often associated with carbohydrate chemistry. The first carbohydrate-based polyamides produced could not be viewed as commercially viable products due to the large number of these steps required. Haworth et. al. reported the condensation of 1,6-diamino-1,6-dideoxy-di-Omethylene-D-mannitol with di-O-methylene-D-glucaric acid82, while Wiggins replaced the acid with 1,2,5,6-di-anhydro-3,4-O-isopropylidene-D-mannitol and produced a polymer that exhibited fibre-forming characteristics83. Polymers, which were produced by Wolfrom et. al. by reacting the O-protected (peracetylated) aldaroyl chloride, 2,3,4,5-tetra-O-acetyl-galactaroyl dichloride with the diamines ethylediamine or piperazine, also used protection/deprotection steps84. In more recent times the synthesis of polyesters containing anhydro- and dianhydroalditols prepared by interfacial polycondensation with various aliphatic and aromatic acids has been reported. This work was then extended to the synthesis of hydrophilic polyamides via the condensation of 2,3,4,5-tetra-Oacetyl-galactaroyl dichloride with various heterocyclic carbohydrate-derived diamino compunds and hexamethylene diamine. These polyamides had their acetyl protecting groups removed via saturation with aqueous NH3 solution85.

Chapter One - Introduction

13

Thiem and Bachmann continued this work to produce polyamides that were formed by reacting various differently modified methyl and benzyl glycosides of 2,6-diaminosaccharides with a selection of different aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic diacid dichlorides86,
87

. García-Martín and Mancera et. al. used the

polycondensation of O-methyl protected sugars to create polyamides. Pentachlorophenyl esters of 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-L-arabinaric acid, 2,3,4-tri-Omethylxylaric acid, 2,3,4,5-tetra-O-methyl-D-mannarate and 2,3,4,5-tetra-Omethylgalactarate were reacted with aliphatic or carbohydrate based diamines8890

.

The first polyamides based on non-protected carbohydrates appeared in the 1970s from Ogata et. al.91-96. Work in this area commenced with research into the typical conditions under which polycondensation reactions were carried out. It was noted that polycondensation reactions, including amidation reactions, consisted of an addition-elimination reaction between the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid and the nucleophilic reagent such as the amine. The whole reaction is essentially an equilibrium97. Polyamide synthesis is usually accomplished by melt polycondensation of dicarboxylic acids or diesters with diamines at elevated temperatures, above the melting points of the resulting polymers, so that the polycondensation equilibrium is shifted toward the polymer formation side by driving leaving groups such as water, out of the system (Figure 1.4)91.

These conditions are too harsh for many monomers, carbohydrates included, to escape decomposition during the polymerisation process. Preliminary work in polycondensation98-100 established that the reaction was strongly controlled by the surrounding media. This was emphasised by the fact that solvents or

Chapter One - Introduction

14

chelating agents could influence the reaction to the extent that the equilibrium was apparently shifted. As the rate-determining step of most polycondensation reactions is the formation of the intermediate given by the rate constant k1, it was hypothesised that the foregoing effect on the equilibrium was due to the formation of an intermediate product between the monomer and solvent. The formation of such an intermediate would accelerate the polycondensation reaction98. Further work into factors affecting polycondensation reactions revealed the structure of the monomers was also influential, and that it was possible to increase the reactivity of monomers by the introduction of active substituents, to such an extent that polycondensation would occur at mild temperatures regardless of the equilibrium. Esters having a thioether group  to a carbonyl group reacted with an amine at room temperature97, 100. It was also shown that Nhydroxyethyl-substituted amines could react with esters below room temperature which implied that polyamides with pendant N-hydroxyethyl groups could be readily prepared99, 100. It was presumed (through evidence provided by reactions of model compounds) that the polycondensation reaction could take place at milder than usual temperatures due to an exchange reaction between the ester and amide groups, proceeding through an oxazolidine intermediate in which the hydroxyethyl group participates (Figure 1.5)99.

Ogata et. al. made a systematic study of the polycondensation reactions of acid derivatives having various heteroatoms at the position  to the carbonyl group.

Chapter One - Introduction

15

They reported that reactivity augmentation of diesters or diacids due to the heteroatom could be arranged in such a way that it mimicked the order of electronegativities of the heteroatoms. The effect of the heteroatom on the reactivity was thought to be an induction effect of the heteroatom on the carbonyl group on the acid or ester. This interaction enhances the reactivity of functional groups to such an extent that the equilibrium was shifted towards the formation of polymers 95, 101-103. The extent of this shift is apparent by the fact that active polycondensation progressed even in methanolic solution, provided that methyl esters were used as monomers104. Further work concluded that the reactivity enhancement of diesters by heteroatoms was superior to that of their -counterparts. The cause of the superior enhancement was attributed to two possible explanations. The first being the fact that the carbonyl group becomes more electrophilic (and hence more susceptible to nucleophilic attack) when the heteroatom is in the  position, and the second was the possibility of a proximity effect of the heteroatom in the reaction intermediate (a hydrogen bond between the heteroatom and the approaching amine may form, hence forming an anchor and aiding the polycondensation reaction). In contrast, introduction of similar heteroatoms into the reacting amine hindered the polycondensation process. The most plausible cause of this is the reduction in basicity of the amine caused by the heteroatom which is turn reduces the reactivity of the amine104. From these studies Ogata et. al.91 concluded that heterogroups such as ether or hydroxyl groups would have an enhancement effect on the reactivity of both esters and amines in polycondensation reactions. Studies on the polycondensation of carboxylic acids having pendant hydroxyl groups focussed on two main methods each producing polymers that no longer had the pendant hydroxy groups105, 106. Melt polycondensation at high temperatures caused cross linking due to the degradation of the monomers, while interfacial polycondensation utilising acid chlorides also caused cross linking due to the participation of the hydroxyl groups91. Ogata et. al. were able to produce

Chapter One - Introduction

16

carbohydrate-based polyamides that retained the pendant hydroxyl groups by reacting ,'-dihydroxyl diesters, particularly L-dimethyl tartarate esters91-93, 107 and diethyl D-galactarate (mucate) esters94, 96, with diamines in solution. Further work noted that reactivity enhancement of the diester could also be achieved by introducing a good leaving group such as p-nitrophenol or thiophenol108. Hashimoto's group produced PHPAs that were based on the dilactones of Dglucose, and D-mannose, D-glucaro- and D-mannaro-1,4:6,3-dilactones, that also featured pendant hydroxyl groups109-111. Hoagland's work elucidated the mechanism of the polymerisation of diethyl galactarate with ethylenediamine112. The pendant hydroxyl groups facilitate a fast five-membered lactonisation step before the slower aminolysis of the resulting lactone. Similar results were found during the aminolysis of diethyl xylarate113. In more recent times the challenge to produce commercially viable PHPAs has been taken up by Kiely et. al. Work from this laboratory has greatly extended both the knowledge of PHPAs, and the variety of PHPAs prepared. PHPAs have been prepared that are based on D-glucaric acid24,
114-117

, D-mannaric acid114,

galactaric acid114, 116 and meso-xylaric acid114. A general preparation scheme for the preparation of carbohydrate-based copolymers that imitates that used for strictly petroleum-based monomers was proposed (Figure 1.6) 118. A lot of Kiely et. al.'s work is aimed at procuding PHPAs that are commercially viable and in keeping with this end goal a list of critical characteristics for the industrial production of such polymers was formulated (Figure 1.7)118.

Kiely's work has extended into developing methods of producing stereoregular head-tail polyamides119, as well as using computer aided structural molecular modelling120 and conformational analysis via MM3(96) software24 to better understand the observed variances in the physical properties of PHPAs derived from D-glucaric acid118. Potential applications of PHPAs such as nitrogen fertilisers121 and biodegradable adhesives122 have been investigated, and patents concerning the manufacture of PHPAs have been created123, 124. Thiem et. al. recently published a description of polydimethylsiloxane polyamides. These polyamides were based on the hydroxyl-protected peracetylated acid chlorides of glucaric and galactaric acid125.

Some Critical Characteristics of Idealised Carbohydrate-Based Polymerisations for Industrial Production. 1. Activated carbohydrate monomers A are available from any simple aldose, e.g. D-glucose, D-galactose, D-xylose, D-mannose etc. 2. Monomers B are relatively inexpensive and readily available. 3. Syntheses of activated carbohydrate monomers A and the polymers ­[A-B]n­ do not require protection-deprotection steps. 4. Polymer isolation and purification utilities established industrial technology. 5. Polymers with reasonably predictable but variable properties can be synthesised by taking into account: a. The structure of the carbohydrate monomer A (i.e. the stereochemistry and number of carbons in the carbohydrate; b. The chain length, degree of branching, and fuctionalisation of monomer B.

1.7 D-Glucaric Acid Based Polyhydroxypolyamides
Although the first unprotected polyhydroxypolyamides based on carbohydrates (L-tartrate92, 103and diethyl mucate94) appeared during the mid 1970s, it was not until the 1990s that polyhydroxypolyamides based on D-glucaric acid were produced110, 111, 115. Hashimoto reacted D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone (as well as its D-mannarocounterpart) with p-xylylenediamine to produce poly(p-xylylene-D-glucaramide). The results from the model reaction between the dilactone and benzylamine in tetrahydrofuran (production of N,N'-dibenzyl-D-glucaramide), suggested that the reaction proceeded through the nucleophilic addition of the amino group in benzylamine to the lactone carbonyl groups accompanied with the opening of the lactone rings (Figure 1.8)109.

triethylamine, to produce poly(alkylene D-glucaramide). The triethylamine served to ensure that the base-induced lactonisation step identified by Hoagland occurred at a reasonable rate even near the end of the reaction when the concentration of the diamine was low. A considerable driving factor in this work was to develop a process that would ultimately be commercially viable. Such a method would avoid the use of water and hence the consequent requirement of removal. This was achieved by the direct acidification/esterification of monopotassium D-glucarate in alcohol solution (Figure 1.10)115.

A further improvement made was to produce specific crystalline and weighable
D-glucaric

esters/lactones from which polyhydroxypolyamides could be

produced. This allowed good stoichiometric control of the aldaric acid monomer and hence enhanced the feasibility of achieving a 1:1 monomer ratio115. Crystalline methyl D-glucarate 1,4-lactone, ethyl D-glucarate 6,3-lactone and Dglucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone were all used to produce a variety of D-glucaramides from different diamines.

different diamines 115, 126. Crystalline methyl D-glucarate 1,4-lactone and ethyl Dglucarate 6,3-lactone proved to be particularly useful as they have a good shelf life and are not readily hydrolysed on standing like D-glucaro-1,4;6,3dilactone127. Additional work73 investigated if the amide forming mechanism that Hoagland reported for esterified meso-galactaric112 and meso-xylaric113 acids applied to esterified D-glucaric acid. Methyl D-glucarate 1,4-lactone and ethyl D-glucarate 6,3-lactone respectively were reacted with n-propylamide to form N,N'-dipropylD-glucaramide. As well as employing
13

C NMR spectroscopy to track the

reaction as Hoagland did, 1H NMR spectroscopy was also used. This method was found to provide more detailed information about the rapid ring opening of the five-membered lactone ring due to its relatively quick FID accumulation time. As well as elucidating the mechanism of the aminolysis of both methyl D-glucarate 1,4-lactone and ethyl D-glucarate 6,3-lactone, this research investigated the contribution that direct aminolysis of the ester carbonyl makes in the aminolysis of esterified D-glucaric acid. Dimethyl L-tartrate was used as a model of an ,dihyroxy esterified aldaric acid that cannot form a five-membered lactone and subsequently cannot experience the aminolysis rate enhancement that occurs because of the formation of such a lactone73. This was one of the compounds originally used by Ogata et. al. when they concluded that aliphatic esters with an alpha hydroxy group undergo aminolysis at enhanced rates compared to aliphatic esters without such a group, because of the extra polarisation of the ester carbonyl group by the hydroxy group103. However because of Hoagland's results112, 113, it was speculated that dimethyl L-tartrate would undergo aminolysis at a much slower rate than methyl D-glucarate 1,4 lactone. This was what was found when both compounds were reacted with n-propylamine (Figure 1.11)73.

1.7.3 Comparison of the Properties of Polyhydroxypolyamides Based on DGlucaric Acid When the properties of polyhydroxypolyamides that are based on D-glucaric acid were compared to those based on other aldaric acids (galactaric, xylaric and Dmannaric)114 it was found that differences in the polymer melting points and water solubilities were largely due to the conformational differences of the monomer aldaryl units. For example the extended zigzag conformation of the galactaric acid units allowed for strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding whereas the bent conformation of the D-glucaric units prevents this interaction, hence these polyamides have lower melting points and higher solubilities than their galactaric acid counterparts. Conformational analysis of D-glucaramides via MM3(96) software and x-ray crystal structures of various D-glucaric acid derivatives backed these findings by indicating that the glucaric acid portion of poly(alkylene D-glucaramides) in solution can take on a variety of conformations, mostly those with sickle arrangements which give rise to a bend in the glucaric acid monomer unit24. The asymmetry of D-glucaric acid allows for three classes of poly(alkylene Dglucaramides) to be assigned24, randomly aligned polyamides114, 115 stereoregular Head, tail- polyamides119 and stereoregular alternating Head, tail ­ tail, headpolyamides (Figure 1.13)24.

for

Polyhydroxypolyamide Production
In order for polyhydroxypolyamides to be a commercial success and compete with petroleum-derived polymers, it is crucial that starting materials are inexpensive and readily available. When all the possible carbohydrate monomers that are commercially available are considered, D-glucaric acid has the most potential in fulfilling this need. Millions of tonnes of D-glucose are produced worldwide each year from the hydrolysis of cornstarch meaning that it is the cheapest monosaccharide available (Table 1.3). The relatively inexpensive process of oxidising D-glucose to D-glucaric acid with nitric acid as the oxidant provides a method of producing a commercially viable source of D-glucaric acid for use in polyhydroxypolyamide production. Polyhydroxypolyamides based on
D-glucaric acid also have the benefits of good biodegradability properties

1.9 Importance of the Equilibrium of D-Glucaric Acid in the Formation of Polyhydroxypolyamides
As discussed above, the use D-glucaric acid for the production of polyhydroxypolyamides has significant advantages. However, unlike other aldaric acids such as galactaric and xylaric, aqueous D-glucaric acid exists in an equilibrium of four species and the common esterified forms of D-glucaric acid

Chapter One - Introduction

25

have ester/lactone structures126. It is probable that these four different forms react at different rates when used to form poly(D-glucaramides). Investigation into the conversion of the diastereoisomeric monolactones (Dglucaro-1,4- and D-glucaro-6,3-lactones) and n-propylamine into poly(Dglucaramides)73, found the process to contain three distinct and consecutive steps, two which were affected by the stereochemistry of the lactone. The steps were the aminolysis of the lactone ester to the corresponding acyclic N-propyl-Dglucaramide monoester, followed by lactonisation to a five-membered lactone amide (this lactone amide has the reciprocals stereochemistry compared to the starting lactone ester), followed by aminolysis of this lactone amide to N,N'dipropyl-D-glucaramide. It was found that the ring opening of the 1,4-lactone ester and 1,4-lactone amide is faster than the ring opening of the corresponding 6,3-lactone ester and 6,3-lactone amide. A convenient method of producing poly(alkylene D-glucaramides) from Dglucose involves the direct use of the mixture of activated forms of aqueous Dglucaric acid (Figure 1.14). This method avoids the use of water and therefore subsequent removal. It also avoids the need to separate the activated forms of Dglucaric acid115,
118

. Factors such as these are essential if production of

poly(alkylene D-glucaramides) is going to be commercially viable. Although qualitative work into the equilibrium products of esterified D-glucaric acid has been reported126, the equilibrium of aqueous D-glucaric acid has not been investigated (Figure 1.15). As this equilibrium occurs before the equilibrium of esterified products, knowledge of the aqueous equilibrium may allow it to be controlled in such a way one has control of relative amounts of the species present in the esterified equilibrium.

1.10 Aims of the Current Work
The purpose of this study was to investigate the equilibrium of aqueous Dglucaric acid. This began with a full NMR spectroscopy assignment of the four species involved. A method of investigating the kinetics of equilibration via NMR spectroscopy was first developed, then used to investigate the equilibration of two starting species (D-glucaro-1,4-lactone and D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone) under neutral and acidic conditions. A mechanism for the equilibration of aqueous D-glucaric acid was proposed. The experimental data was used to produce equilibrium constants, as well as estimates of rate constants involved in the mechanism proposed. The simulation software MATLAB was used to simulate the reactions involved in the mechanism. Simulations were used to adjust the estimates of rate constants and improve the fits between simulated and experiment data.

Chapter Two ­ Experimental

2.1 Materials
D-Glucaro-1,4-monolactone dihydrate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. D-

glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone was produced at The University of Montana by Dr. Merilyn Manley-Harris. Monopotassium glucarate was prepared by a standard method23 and supplied by The University of Montana. The purity of these chemicals was checked via NMR spectroscopy. Dowex® 50WX8 Hydrogen Form resin (particle size 50-100 mesh) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. This was thoroughly washed with distilled water before use. Solvents deuterium oxide (99.9 atom % deuterium, glass distilled) and dimethyl sulfoxide (99.9% purity, spectrophotometric grade) were purchased from SigmaAldrich A 35% weight/weight solution of deuterium chloride (99% atom deuterium) in deuterium oxide was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

2.2 Sample Preparation
Starting material (either D-glucaro-1,4-lactone or D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone) (50 mg) was added to deuterium oxide (D2O) (0.6 mL) in a vial. In the samples that had deuterium chloride (DCl) added this was added before a small drop of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added, and the resulting solution briefly shaken to dissolve the starting material. The solution was transferred to a 5mm NMR tube.

2.3 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR)
2.3.1 Spectrometer Details NMR spectra were recorded using two spectrometers. A Bruker Avance AC-300 Fourier Transform NMR spectrometer with a 5mm inverse probe (300.1 3MHz for 1H and 74.48MHz for
13

C) operating at 300K (27°C) was used for the 1H

NMR spectroscopy kinetic experiments. A Bruker DRX400 400MHz spectrometer (1H, 13C, DEPT, DQFCOSY, COSY, HSQC, HMBC, SELTOCSY SELNOESY experiments) with a 5mm inverse probe (400.13MHz for 1H and 100.62MHz
13

C) operating at 303K (30°C) was

used for assigning spectra. See appendix two for NMR spectroscopy parameters (the parameters used for D-glucaro-1,4-lactone are given as a representative example).

2.3.2 Use of 1H NMR Spectroscopy for Kinetic Information Each sample was used in a set of 1H NMR spectroscopy experiments. To produce each set of experiments, standard 1H NMR spectroscopy parameters with 128 scans were used to create the first experiment in each set. The spectrometer was shimmed and tuned on a 5mm NMR tube containing D2O (0.6 mL), before this tube was exchanged for the tube containing the sample. A Bruker Multi_zgvd program was used to create an experiment set containing 50-100 (depending on time available) experiments that were identical to the first one. The Multi_zgvd program was also used to build a fixed delay of five minutes between each of the experiments. Each experiment was subsequently manually processed and integrated in the same way, with the same absolute intensity relative to the DMSO signal in the first experiment in each experiment set. Each spectrum was calibrated by means of setting the DMSO signal (singlet) to 2.71ppm128.

Chapter Two - Experimental Each set of experiments was performed in duplicate.

2. 4 Preparation of D-Glucaric Acid Lactone Mix
In an attempt to produce D-glucaro-6,3-monolactone, a lactone mix was made. Monopotassium D-glucarate (20 g, 0.086 mol) was added to 250 mL of distilled water in a 2.0L conical flask. Dowex 50WX8-100 ion exchange resin (70 mL, H+), which had been pre-washed with distilled water until the wash water was colourless, was added to the flask. The mixture was shaken on a radial shaker (4 h) during which time the monopotassium glucarate gradually dissolved. Vacuum filtration was used to remove the resin and the filtrate was evaporated via vacuum filtration until an amber syrup was reached. This method is similar to that used by Bose et. al.129, and it has been shown that this lactone mix contains a mixture of D-glucaric acid, D-glucaro-1,4-lactone, D-glucaro-6,3-lactone and Dglucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone130. To prepare D-glucaro-6,3-lactone this lactone mix is usually seeded with a pure sample of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone 23, 129 or left to allow the D-glucaro-1,4-lactone to crystallise out before recrystallising the supernatant to form D-glucaro-6,3-lactone7. As there was no pure sample to seed the lactone mix with conventional crystallisation techniques were used in an attempt to produce crystals from the syrup. This included standing flask of syrup in a beaker of dicholoromethane.

Chapter Three ­ Assignment of Spectra
Before NMR spectroscopy could be used to investigate the equilibria of aqueous
D-glucaric acid, it was essential that the spectra of the species were fully assigned

and compared to literature results. This would allow confident signal selection for integration, and would give a better understanding of the species involved in the equilibrium.

3.1 Previous NMR Spectroscopy Results
The conformations of the D-glucarolactones and D-glucaric acid in solution were investigated with an aim of explaining the behaviour of these compounds in biological systems and extending the knowledge of the conformations of sugar lactones12, 131. Infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy and optical rotary dispersion have been used in an attempt to assign the conformations of D-glucaric acid and its lactones. 60MHz 1HNMR spectroscopy was also used12, 132, however only Dglucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone gave a first order spectrum. The use of a lanthanide shift reagent (praseodymium chloride) gave first order 1H NMR spectra of all species at 100MHz. These conformations were confirmed with spectroscopy results12. Assignments of spectra were made according to general rules that have been applied with 1,4-lactones together with others developed for furanoid sugars. As 2D experiments were not used to confirm these assignments, it is acknowledged that some of the assignments may be interchanged. The assignments made for the
D-glucaric acid species were in general agreement with those made for the
13

C NMR

aldono-1,4-lactones12, 131. These assignments were used to assign the spectrum of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3dilactone when it was used as an activated form of D-glucaric acid for PHPA production115.

Chapter Three ­ Assignment of Spectra

3.2 Current NMR Spectroscopy Results
2D correlation spectroscopy, as well as the usual 1D experiments, was used to assign the spectra of the four species of aqueous D-glucaric acid. COSY (COrrelation SpectroscopY) experiments produce off-diagonal or cross peaks for all protons that have significant J-J coupling133. These cross peaks can then be used to determine which protons are coupled to each other. HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Correlation) (also called HMQC ­ Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Coherence) is a proton-detected
1

H-13C correlation

experiment in which only directly attached proton-carbon coupling is observed133. The HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Coherence) is another proton detected experiment, but instead of direct proton-carbon coupling, this experiment that capitalises on two and three bond proton-carbon couplings133. By utilising the above correlation experiments as well as the 1D 1H and spectroscopy experiments, it is possible to fully assign spectra. Past literature results have assigned spectra by relying on consideration of the shielding effects felt by each proton or carbon as well as taking into account the rules developed for carbohydrate -lactones12,
126 13

C NMR

. These results and

considerations make good starting points when trying to assign 2D spectra. The 2D spectra can also be used to prove or disprove these considerations. DEPT experiments were run, but because the species only had tertiary and quaternary carbons, the information provided by these spectra was not beneficial to the assignment process. Note that in some cases the full spectrum has not been shown as because of equilibration, signals relating to the other species have started to appear. To minimise this appearance fresh samples of the species were used to run most of the NMR spectroscopy experiments instead of using the same sample for the suite of experiments.

COSY: The previous assignment of H-2 was used as a starting point. If the signal at 4.5 ppm was H-2 then this signal should correlate to only one other signal (H-3). This was the case, so the signal at 4.17 ppm was assigned H-3. If these assignments were correct, H-3 should correlate to another signal (H-4), which in

Chapter Three ­ Assignment of Spectra

34

turn should correlate to another signal (H-5). This proved to be true and the signal at 4.00 ppm was assigned to be H-4 and the signal at 4.39 ppm H-5.

HSQC:

The results from the COSY were used to assign the HSQC spectrum. As several of the carbon signals were very close to one another this required zooming in on the required section of the spectrum. This allowed the following assignments: 71.92ppm (C-2), 71.71 ppm (C-3), 73.43 ppm (C-4) and 71.75 ppm (C-5).

HMBC:

After the HSQC results were taken into account, only two signals will remain in the carbon spectrum, those resulting from C-1 and C-6. As quaternary carbons do not show in HSQC spectra, a HMBC experiment was run to discriminate between the two carbon signals at 176.13 ppm and 175.83 ppm. As the carbon resonances are very close, the required section of the HMBC was enlarged to allow accurate assignments. The possible correlations that may be seen in the HMBC spectrum of D-glucaric acid are shown (Figure 3.4). Careful inspection of the HMBC spectrum allowed the signals at 176.13 ppm (C-1) and 175.83 (C6) to be assigned (Figures 3.5 and 3.6).

One of these had no further correlations and hence had to be H-5 (4.67 ppm) while the other proton was assigned to be H-3 (4.63 ppm). This proton (H-3) correlated to the remaining proton, which was assigned H-2 (4.77 ppm) (Figure 3.10).

As D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone equilbrates rapidly, in some cases the signals that relate to this species have been highlighted on the scanned spectra.

H NMR:

According to literature the quasiequatorial H-2 is the most shielded proton in Dglucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone because of its orientation between O-1 and O-312, therefore the signal at 4.59 ppm was assigned to be H-2 (Figure 3.16).

The assignment of H-2 (4.59 ppm) was used as a starting point. This signal correlated to one other signal that was assigned as H-3 (5.18 ppm). H-3 correlated to one other signal at 5.49 ppm (H-4), which in turn correlated to one other signal at 4.96 ppm (H-5) (Figure 3.17).

SELNOESY:

As D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone contains two fused rings, the interactions of the protons through space could be investigated to confirm the starting assignment of H-2. As this signal was a doublet (although it appears as a singlet) then inspection of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone indicates that this signal could also be H-5 as this proton also only has one vicinal proton. Investigation of a model of
D-glucaro-1,4;63-dilactone revealed that protons H-5, H-4 and H-3 were

together on one side of the molecular place whereas H-2 was on the other side. Therefore H-5, H-4 and H-3 would have through space interactions with each other while there would be no such interactions between H-2 and the other

Chapter Three ­ Assignment of Spectra

protons. A SELNOESY experiment irradiates a selected signal and uses the appearance of other signals to indicate through-space interactions. If the signal assigned to H-5 (4.96 ppm) is irradiated the signals relating to H-4 (5.49 ppm) and H-3 (5.18 ppm) should appear. The signal relating to H-4 should appear before the signal relating to H-3 as H-4 is closer to H-5 than H-3 is. A SELNOESY experiment was run with the signal at 4.96 ppm (H-5) irradiated. The signal at 5.49 ppm (H-4) appeared first, followed by the signal at 5.18 ppm (H-3). No other signals appeared. This result proved that the previous assignments were correct. In a second SELNOESY experiment the signal at 4.59 ppm (H-2) was irradiated. In this experiment no other signals appeared, confirming that H-2 was in a different plane with respect to the other protons. The p12 and sp2 parameters control the irradiation in a SELNOESY experiment. Both SELNOESY experiments were run using the settings for a normal multiplet (p12 = 160,000 sec; sp2 = 74db).

HSQC:

The results from the COSY experiment were used to assign the HSQC spectrum. This allowed the following carbon signals to be assigned: 70.51 ppm (C-2), 80.88 ppm (C-3), 70.76 ppm (C-4) and 68.92 ppm (C-5).

The results from the HSQC spectrum can be used to assign C-2, C-3, C-4 and C5 signals on the 13C NMR spectrum. As stated before C-1 and C-6 resonate at the same value (175.81 ppm), however as discussed above resolution enhancement split the signal into two (175.83 ppm and 175.81 ppm). As the 13C spectrum has a large spectral window, it has been presented in three sections (Figures 3.20 3.22).

The 13C signals of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone can be identified by assigning all of the other carbon signals in the 13C NMR spectrum of the equilibrated mixture. Those signals remaining are those of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone. As the 13C spectrum has a large spectral window, it has been presented in two sections (Figures 3.23 and

signals corresponding to D-glucaro-6,3-lactone are actually the largest signals in the upfield section.

COSY:

The proton signals identified on the HSQC spectrum were highlighted on an enlarged section of the COSY of the equilibrated sample (Figure 3.26). It was noted that two of these signals correlated to just one other signal (therefore could be H-2 or H-5) while the other two signals correlated to two other signals (therefore could be H3 or H-4). Therefore H-2 and H-5 were either 4.69 ppm or 4.76 pp, while H-3 and H-4 were either 4.71 ppm or 4.74 ppm. The COSY spectrum was assigned after the HMBC results were interpreted.

Assignment of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone spectrum:

The HMBC results indicate that the proton signal at 4.76 ppm must be H-5. If this signal was H-2, the signal at 4.74 ppm would be H-4 (from COSY). It is not possible (see Figure 3.28) for C-1 to be correlated to H-4 (from HMBC). Therefore the signal at 4.76 ppm must be H-5, which makes the signal at 4.74ppm H-3 (from COSY). C-6 can be correlated to H-3 and H-4 (3J) and H-5 (2J), therefore the signal at 178.21 ppm is C-6. The 4.69 ppm (H) and 173.90 ppm (C) correlation in the HMBC is the correlation between C-1 and H-2 (2J). Combining the results from the COSY, HSQC and HMBC spectra allowed the following assignments:

3.3 Comparison of Experimental Data with Literature
The experimental NMR spectroscopy assignment were compared to those reported12. As the reported results relied on shielding/deshielding considerations and the use of a lanthanide shift reagent to gain first order 1H NMR spectra, there were a few differences between the reported assignments and the experimental results. Also the reported assignments were produced using a 100 MHz spectrometer while the experimental results were produced using a 400 MHz spectrometer, therefore this will change the absolute chemical shifts of the signals.

3.3.1. D-Glucaric Acid

The 1H NMR signals from D-glucaric acid were assigned (Table 3.1) in the same order (i.e. same relative position) as those that were reported (Table 3.2), and the multiplicity of the signals matched. The absolute chemical shifts were different but this was expected, as discussed above. The 13C NMR signals were assigned (Table 3.3). The reported results (Table 3.4) for the
13

C NMR assignments

include many assignments that can be interchanged; therefore it is not worthwhile comparing these with the experimental results.

3.3.2 D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone

The relative positions of the 1H assignments of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone are different between reported and experimental. H-4 is the furthest downfield signal in both sets of results but this is the only similarity. The multiplicity of the signals matched. Again the reported assignments that can be interchanged.
13

C NMR assignments include many

3.3.3 D-Glucaro-6,3-lactone

The relative positions for the signals of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone do not match between experimental and reported results. No multiplicities were recorded for the experimental results of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone due to the considerable overlap seen. On investigation of the structure of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone it is clear that H-

Chapter Three ­ Assignment of Spectra

53

2 and H-5 should each be a doublet (they both have one vicinal proton) while H3 and H-4 should each be a doublet of doublets(as they both have two nonequivalent vicinal protons). This is what is seen in the reported results. Again the reported
13

C NMR assignments include many assignments that can be

interchanged.

3.3.4 D-Glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone

The 1H signals from D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone were assigned in the same relative order as those reported. The reported results saw a octet signal for H-4 of
D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone

and did not include a multiplicity for the

corresponding H-2 signal. The experimental results saw H-4 as a doublet of doublets, while H-2 was a singlet (probably a very fine doublet). The appearance of this singlet was also reported by Kiely et. al115. The relative position of the 13C NMR signals is the same between reported results and experimental results. Resolution enhancement allowed the observation of a separate signal for C-1 and C-6 for D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone in the experimental results however lack of resolution between these signals in the HMBC spectrum prevented them being assigned to separate carbons.

Chapter Four ­ Method Development

4.1 Introduction
For NMR spectroscopy data to be utilised in accurate kinetic analysis there are several conditions that have to be optimised. A considerable amount of time went into planning and developing a method that would not only be accurate but would make efficient use of the NMR spectroscopy resources available, keeping in mind that other users needed access to these facilities as well. both 1H and evaluated. A lot of the terminology used in this section relates to the Bruker suite of NMR spectrometers, however when such a term appears it will be described fully.

4.2 Overlap of Signals
Accurate integration is essential for kinetic data to be meaningful. If two signals overlap each other then neither can be integrated accurately. The 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 4.1) of aqueous D-glucaric acid involves significant overlapping especially in the region between 4 ppm and 5 ppm where no individual signals can be resolved. The corresponding involves less overlapping (Figure 4.2).

4.3 FID Accumulation Time
A major difference between
13

C and 1H spectroscopy is the FID accumulation

time. 1H FID accumulation time is relatively quick and respectable signal to noise can be obtained in a matter of minutes; 13C FID collection is much slower and experiments can take in the range of hours, even with strong samples. It was important that an inverse-gated parameter set was used for the 13C experiments. This eliminates NOE variations between carbon signals and therefore allows for accurate integration. However loss of the NOE means that signal intensity decreases and more scans may be needed133. If FID collection takes for example one hour, then the resulting spectrum is an average of that hour. Therefore any changes in the species present are averaged for that hour. In contrast, the much

Chapter Four ­ Method Development

57

shorter FID accumulation of the 1H experiment allows an experiment to be run at discrete times throughout that hour, thereby producing an accurate depiction of the changes in the species present. In preliminary 13C experiments it was obvious that the sample began to equilibrate before sufficient scans had been run to gain satisfactory signal to noise as signals corresponding to the other species began to appear in the spectrum.

4.3.1 Optimisation of Delay Time

In an attempt to reduce the number of scans needed to gain good signal to noise and hopefully decrease the time needed for FID accumulation in the experiment, the parameters used in the
13 13

C

C experiment were optimised. An

important parameter in 13C NMR spectroscopy is the delay between acquisitions (d1). If d1 is too short then not all of the carbons will be equally relaxed. Therefore some signals will be weak and more scans would be needed. By optimising d1 all carbon atoms would be fully relaxed between scans and consequently the resulting signals would be more intense. The results from the optimisation demonstrated that the optimum d1 for the 13C inverse-gated NMR experiments on D-glucaric acid and its lactones was approximately sixty seconds. Clearly a d1 of sixty seconds is not practical due to the large amount of time needed per scan.

4.3.2 A Dynamic (Rapid) Method for 13C NMR Spectroscopy

As part of a Doctoral thesis on Urea-Formaldehyde a dynamic or rapid method was developed to study the "real time" polymerisation of these resins via
13

C

NMR spectroscopy134. This method involved performing NMR spectroscopy experiments using the dynamic method (13C scan repetition time of 1.4 seconds) and using mathematics to calculate the expected signal integrals if a standard 13C experiment (13C scan repetition time of 4.9 seconds) had been performed. Although this procedure had potential, it was obvious that it had taken considerable time to optimise it for the reactions being studied. Therefore it was

Chapter Four ­ Method Development

58

decided that it would not be practical in the timeframe of a MSc to develop a corresponding procedure for the aqueous D-glucaric acid species.

4.4 HOD Signal Interference
Carbohydrate 1H NMR spectroscopy routinely uses deuterium oxide as a solvent. This practise greatly simplifies what would otherwise be very complex spectra. The hydroxyl hydrogens are rapidly exchanged with deuterium so that they become "invisible" in 1H NMR spectroscopy experiments. This not only reduces the number of signals that are seen, but it also greatly reduces the amount of overlap between signals that would have had very similar chemical shifts. However one of the consequences of using this solvent is the appearance of the HOD signal at 4-5ppm. This is often a broad signal and can be troublesome if sample signals occur in this region. The 1HNMR spectra of D-glucaric acid and its lactones include many signals in the region between 4-5ppm (Figure 4.1). Therefore the occurrence of the HOD signal affects the ability to interpret, and accurately integrate the resulting spectra. There are means to either reduce the size of the HOD signal or to eliminate it completely. The presaturation experiment is a variation of the 1H NMR spectroscopy experiment that sees the "unwanted" signal irradiated so that it collapses and becomes smaller, or disappears from the spectrum. However, when one signal is irradiated, signals close to it are also affected. This means that it would no longer be appropriate to integrate the surrounding signals as it would be impossible to tell if they were affected by the irradiation, or to what extent that they were affected. A double quantum filtered COSY experiment is a 2D experiment that removes the HOD signal. However, 2D experiments cannot be used for accurate quantitative work. Another possible way of decreasing the effect of the HOD signal is to increase the temperature of the experiments. As the temperature increases the HOD signal moves downfield, reducing interference with the sample signals. A series of 1H

Chapter Four ­ Method Development

59

NMR spectroscopy experiments were run at increased temperatures to determine the affects on the HOD signal. Each increase in temperature shifted the HOD signal slightly more downfield. However even in the experiment at 70°C the HOD signal was still not "clear" from the sample signals. Increased temperature also, of course, affects kinetics and equilibria. It was especially probable that increased temperature would cause the relative amount of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3dilactone present to increase11.

4.5 Choice of 1HNMR Spectroscopy
When investigating the kinetics of a reaction it is vital that the data obtained provides an accurate description of the experimental situation. If the situation is changing at a considerable speed it is important that the method used to investigate is able to keep up with these changes. Although
1

H NMR

spectroscopy is not without its problems, as discussed above, its speed is such a major advantage over 13C NMR spectroscopy that it was chosen as the preferred method for this work. A similar decision was made in an investigation of the formation of D-glucaric based polyhydroxypolyamides73.

4.6 Experimental Factors
After the decision to use 1H NMR spectroscopy rather than ensure the best possible results from the experiments.
13

C had been made

there were several experimental factors to be investigated and optimised to

4.6.1 Choice of Signals to Integrate

It was essential that appropriate signals were chosen for integration. A signal was needed for each species that did not overlap with any other species' signal or the HOD signal. Careful investigation of the spectra allowed the following signals (Figure 4.3) to be selected to represent each species: 4.00 ppm (H-4 D-glucaric acid), 5.15 ppm (H-4 D-glucaro-1,4-lactone) and 5.49 ppm (H-4 D-glucaro1,4;6,3-dilactone). These signals were well resolved from other species' signals as well as the HOD signal. The signal selected for D-glucaro-1,4-lactone is

Chapter Four ­ Method Development

60

relatively close to the H-3 signal of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone. However if this area is enlarged accurate integration is possible and there are no other signals for
D-glucaro-1,4-lactone that are suitable.

4.6.2 Determining the Relative Concentration of D-Glucaro-6,3-lactone

As no resolved signal could be identified for the D-glucaro-6,3-monolactone an alternative method of obtaining data for this compound had to be developed. A SELTOCSY experiment was used in an attempt to find signals that resulted from the D-glucaro-6,3-monolactone. A SELTOCSY experiment irradiates a selected signal. The appearance of other signals is used to indicate vicinal protons. However no resolved signals could be identified for D-glucaro-6,3-lactone, therefore no signal could be selected for irradiation. After assigning the spectra of D-glucaric acid, D-glucaro-1,4-monolactone and
D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dialactone, the spectra of samples that had equilibrated was

investigated and the known signals labelled. This allowed identification of the

Chapter Four ­ Method Development

61

region where the signals resulting from the D-glucaro-6,3-monolactone occurred (Figure 4.4). These signals appeared between 4.6 ppm and 4.8 ppm and overlapped signals from D-glucaro-1,4-monolactone (three signals) and D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dialactone (one signal). In experiments where one or more equivalents of DCl were added the HOD signal was shifted slightly downfield so that it was clear from this region. In experiments with less than one molar equivalent of DCl added the HOD signal occurred in this overlapping region. Therefore it was decided that in experiments where the HOD signal did not overlap it would be accurate to integrate the entire region of overlapping signals and subtract the theoretical integral value from D-glucaro-1,4-monolactone (integral for three protons) and
D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dialactone (one integral). This method proved to be reasonably

precise as the graphs produced between duplicates were similar.

When starting with D-glucaro-1,4-monolactone, D-glucaro-6,3-monolactone forms rather slowly (this is expected as the two monolactones can not directly interchange). In the early stages of these experiment sets the concentration of the
D-glucaro-6,3-monolactone is so minimal that it was actually less than the errors

involved with its calculation. As an area of the spectrum was integrated and then the theoretical integrals of four other signals subtracted (one from D-glucaro1,4;6,3-dialactone and three from D-glucaro-1,4-monolactone), the integral errors

Chapter Four ­ Method Development

62

associated with five signals affect the value for the relative integral size of Dglucaro-6,3-monolactone. This is why at the start of the D-glucaro-1,4monolactone experiment sets the integral size of the D-glucaro-6,3-monolactone appears as a negative value. However once the relative concentration of Dglucaro-6,3-monolactone increased the relative integral size became larger than the errors involved and subsequently was positive.

For the investigation of all the species present at equilibrium, it was important that a suitable method was developed to allow the relative intensities to be conveyed concisely. It was more significant to be able to relate the relative concentrations of the species to each other, rather than knowing their absolute values. An appropriate way of achieving this is to "spike" each sample with a substance that will produce a signal that occurs in a region of the spectrum where no sample signals appear. A suitable additive for the current samples was dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Dimethyl sulfoxide in deuterium oxide produces a singlet in 1H NMR spectra at 2.71ppm128, which is well clear from the signals of aqueous D-glucaric acid and its lactones. A small drop of DMSO was therefore added to each sample as an internal standard. After some examination it was decided that it would be most accurate to integrate the first spectrum in each set and set the DMSO signal intensity to 1.0000. From here each subsequent spectrum in the experiment set was integrated to the scale of the first experiment. This meant that every signal was integrated to the same relative scale. Each experiment was carried out in duplicate. As the data from each experiment was relative rather than absolute, direct comparisons between integral sizes were not possible. However comparing the graphs produced between duplicates gave an indication of how similar the duplicated results were. If the line on the graph for a particular species had a similar shape (similar slope, timescale etc) between the original experiment set and the duplicate it was concluded that the results for that species were consistent.

Chapter Four ­ Method Development
4.6.4 Length of Each Experiment

63

To ensure sufficient signal to noise it was decided that each experiment would have 128 scans. This number produced spectra that had signals that were very well resolved to the baseline and hence were able to be integrated accurately. The experimental time of approximately eight minutes (seven minutes, fifty seven seconds) was still short enough to optimise the time benefits achieved via 1H NMR spectroscopy.

4.6.5 Multi_zgvd Development

To investigate the change in the species relative concentrations with time it was necessary to develop a system where it was possible to build in a delay between experiments. The Bruker Multi_zgvd program allowed this. This program allows a set of NMR spectroscopy experiments to be created with a delay between each subsequent experiment. Although the `vd' in the name stands for variable delay, the user can select either variable delays (which are created via a desired list of delays) or a fixed delay (which is entered when the Multi_zgvd program is started). It was decided that a fixed delay of five minutes would produce an experiment set that contained 1H NMR spectroscopy experiments that would provide accurate kinetic information. As five minutes is a relatively short amount of time, the experiments in the set would be close enough together in time so that no kinetic changes were missed. By creating the first experiment in the set and then choosing a fixed delay of five minutes and the appropriate number of experiments for that set, the Multi_zgvd program creates the required number of subsequent experiments so that they are identical to the first. Starting the Multi_zgvd program starts the first experiment running. Once this is finished the Multi_zgvd program waits the fixed delay of five minutes before starting the next experiment and subsequent experiments. This allows discrete spectra to run over a period of time, providing valuable kinetic information.

Chapter Four ­ Method Development
4.6.6 Length of Each Set of Experiments

64

The length of each set of experiments had to be decided after considering how long it would take each sample to reach equilibrium as well as taking into account how much time each set of experiments could practically take considering that other users needed to have access to the spectrometer. During prime time hours the maximum amount of time for use of the spectrometer is four hours to ensure that all users have fair access. Preliminary work showed that four hours was insufficient for the samples to reach any sort of equilibrium, therefore at least an overnight run was needed. Depending on the spectrometer time available each set of experiments contained 50-100 experiments.

4.6.7 Quick Experimental Set Up

In order for any kinetic information gained from NMR spectroscopy to be accurate with regards to the timescale it is essential that the time between sample preparation and the start of the NMR spectroscopy experiment be minimised. To help ensure this the spectrometer was shimmed and tuned on a NMR tube containing D2O before the sample tube was inserted.

4.6.8 Errors Involved

The main source of error involved with the experiments was the accuracy with which one could integrate the signals involved. NMR spectroscopy integration is moderately subjective which implies that errors could arise because of the way in which signals are integrated. For example the changes in the integral size of a signal between spectra could be a result of a difference in the size of area used to produce the integral, rather than a direct result of a change in the species' relative concentration. To overcome this problem careful integration is needed to ensure that the same area for each signal is integrated from spectrum to spectrum. Defining the area to be integrated via a dialog box was initially considered to be possibly the most accurate way in which to integrate as one could simply type in the two chemical shifts that defined the area that was to be integrated. However this method of integration

Chapter Four ­ Method Development

65

can be affected by small shifts of the spectrum. Although each spectrum was calibrated via the DMSO signal at 2.71 ppm, tiny shifts in the entire spectrum were sometimes observed between spectra. This would have affected the accuracy of the dialog method. Instead the method of manually defining the area for integration via the mouse cursor was deemed to be more accurate than using the dialog tool. Although manual definition is a time-consuming technique, as long as each signal was suitably enlarged very accurate integration is possible. However factors such as computer screen resolution and human error impose errors on this method. Therefore a method to estimate the errors involved was required. Although the sample signals had the ability of changing throughout the set of spectra as their relative concentrations changed, the DMSO signal size remains identical as the concentration of DMSO remains unchanged between spectra in the same set of experiments. This characteristic can be exploited in a method to determine the accuracy of integration. All spectra in a set are integrated on a scale that is relative to the size of the DMSO signal in the first spectrum therefore it is not necessary to integrate the DMSO signal in consequent spectra. However if the DMSO signal in each experiment is integrated its size can be compared to the DSMO integral in the first experiment of 1.0000. Any deviations from 1.0000 can be designated as errors. Although this method of assuming errors involves a lot of extra integration it gives a reliable description of how much error is involved with manual integration. After all of the DMSO integrals were collected from each set of experiments the lowest DMSO integral was 0.97 and the highest was 1.03. Therefore it was estimated that the error in each integral was plus and minus 0.03

Chapter Five ­ Results and Discussion
To investigate the equilibrium of aqueous D-glucaric acid equilibration, reactions under different conditions were followed via 1H NMR spectroscopy. The equilibration of both starting species (D-glucaro-1,4-lactone and D-glucaro1,4;6,3-dilactone) in neutral aqueous solution was investigated, before the equilibration under acid conditions was considered. Investigating the affects of acidic conditions on the equilibration was deemed significant as a solution of the acid catalysed methanol esterification products of D-glucaric acid has been identified as a suitably "activated" form of D-glucaric acid for PHPA production115, 126. Altering the amount of molar equivalents of DCl added to the samples was used as a convenient method of creating differing acidic environments. The signal selected for species (see section 4.6.1) in each experiment was integrated with respect to the size of the DMSO signal of the first experiment in each set. The integration vale for each signal was recorded with the time (in seconds) that represented halfway through the NMR spectroscopy experiment from which the results were obtained. The results were plotted to produce graphs. Each set of experiments was carried out in duplicate therefore producing two graphs for each experiment set. The experiment sets with one or more molar equivalents of DCl added contain data on all four species present in aqueous D-glucaric acid (as the addition of this much acid moves the HOD signal away from the region that the signals from Dglucaro-6,3-lactone appear in so that approximated values for the 6,3-lactone can be obtained). The experiment sets with less than one molar equivalent of DCl added only have data for three of the species (the HOD overlaps the region where the signals from D-glucaro-6,3-lactone appear).

The error in the integrals size of each data point is plus and minus 0.3. Error bars have not been plotted on the graphs however, because their relatively small size causes the data points to become distorted. Raw data is in appendix three.

appeared to be relatively stable with respect to

equilibration under neutral conditions (Figures 5.1 and 5.2). Its relative concentration dropped slightly within the first 20,000 seconds but remained relatively stable for the remainder of the time. The relative concentration of Dglucaric acid slowly rose, while the relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-6,3dilactone remained stable at a relatively low value.

5.1.2 D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone Plus Quarter Equivalent DCl in Deuterium Oxide

The relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone fell steadily within the first 20,000 seconds as the relative concentration of D-glucaric acid rose at approximately the same rate (Figures 5.3 and 5.4). By the end of the experiment set the relative concentrations of these two species was approximately the same. The relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-6,3-dilactone once again remained stable at a relatively low value.

70

The results from these experiment sets (Figures 5.5 and 5.6) were very similar to those from the sets with a quarter equivalent of DCl. The only difference was that the relative concentration of D-glucaric acid appeared to equilibrate at a slightly higher value than that of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone.

5.1.4 D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone Plus Three Quarter Equivalent DCl in Deuterium Oxide

Again these experiment sets (Figures 5.7 and 5.8) produced similar results those experiment sets containing quarter and half equivalents of DCl. The difference between the relative equilibrium concentrations of D-glucaric acid and Dglucaro-1,4-lactone was slightly larger than that of the previous experiment sets. The relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone was once again relatively low and stable.

5.1.5 D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone Plus Equivalent DCl in Deuterium Oxide

These experiment sets (Figures 5.9 and 5.10) included data for the D-glucaro6,3-lactone. This species' relative concentration slowly increased for the first 40,000 seconds before it reached its equilibration concentration. The relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone behaved in a similar way to previous sets. The relative concentration of D-glucaric acid rose to reach an equilibrium concentration slightly higher than that of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone. The relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone remained similar to previous experiment sets.

5.1.6 D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone Plus One and a Half Equivalent DCl in Deuterium Oxide

The results from these experiments sets (Figures 5.11 and 5.12) were very similar to those obtained from the sets with one equivalent DCl. The only difference being that the relative concentration of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone remains at a lower level in the duplicate set than that of the same species in the original experiment set.

5.1.7 Overall Discussion for D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone as the Starting Species

The results obtained from the experiment sets with D-glucaro-1,4-lactone as the stating species were very reproducible when the duplicate sets were compared to the original sets. When the mass balance of all of the experiment sets that included all four species was investigated, it was found that this was essentially consistent throughout the experiment sets. As a group the results obtained from each of the experiment sets were in fact very similar, especially those with added DCl. In neutral solution D-glucaro-1,4lactone appeared to be relatively stable against equilibration. When DCl was added (even when only a quarter molar equivalent was added) the relative concentration steadily decreased to an equilibration concentration that was considerably lower than that of its starting concentration. The relative concentration of D-glucaric acid increased through the duration of all experiment sets, especially those with added DCl. In the experiment sets that had data for the relative concentration of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone, its starting relative concentration was low. This is because D-glucaro-6,3-lactone can not directly form
D-glucaro-1,4-lactone, therefore it can not form until some of the D-glucaro-1,4-

lactone has converted to D-glucaric acid (or D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone ­ it is unlikely however that much D-glucaro-6,3-lactone forms from this path as the concentration of the dilactone is relatively low throughout the experiment set). In those experiment sets with a half equivalent or more of DCl added the relative equilibration concentration of D-glucaric acid was higher than that of D-glucaro1,4-lactone. The relative concentration of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone (in those sets

Chapter Five ­ Results and Discussion

75

where it was measured) was slightly lower than that of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone. The concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-;6,3-dilactone was relatively low and stable throughout all of the experiment sets.

5.2 D-Glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone as the Starting Species
5.2.1 D-Glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone in Deuterium Oxide

The results from these experiment sets (Figures 5.13 and 5.14) showed that Dglucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone is not stable against equilibration in neutral solution. The relative concentration of this species steadily decreased throughout the experiments set. The relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone steadily increased, although in the duplicate experiment set it appears to reach its equilibration concentration within the timeframe of the experiment set. The relative concentration of D-glucaric acid started to increase once the relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone had increased. This is because D-glucaric acid cannot form directly from D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone but can form from Dglucaro-1,4-lactone (and also from D-glucaro-6,3-lactone).

5.2.2 D-Glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone Plus Half Equivalent DCl in Deuterium Oxide

The relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone rapidly dropped (Figures 5.15 and 5.16) to approximately the same level that it is throughout the experiment sets with D-glucaro-1,4-lactone as the starting species. This drop occurred in around ten experiments. The relative concentration of D-glucaric acid steadily rose for the first 30,000-40,000 seconds before reaching its equilibrium concentration. The relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone started at a higher level than the D-glucaric acid then increased for the first few experiments before remaining at a constant relative concentration for the remainder of the experiment set. The relative equilibrium concentration of D-glucaric acid is higher than that of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone.

These experiments included data for the D-glucaro-6,3-lactone (Figures 5.17
and 5.18).

Again the relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone

rapidly dropped to approximately the same level that it is throughout the experiment sets with D-glucaro-1,4-lactone as the starting species. This drop occurred in around ten experiments. The relative concentration of D-glucaric acid steadily rose for the first 30,000-40,000 seconds before reaching its equilibrium concentration. The relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone started at a higher level than the D- glucaric acid, then increased for the first few experiments before it remained at a constant relative concentration for the remainder of the experiment set. Again the relative concentration of D-glucaric acid at equilibrium is higher than that of D-glucaor-1,4-lactone. The relative concentration of Dglucaro-6,3-lactone increased rapidly for the first five or six experiments before steadily decreasing until approximately 20,000 seconds and remaining steady for the rest of the experiment set. In the duplicate experiment set the relative starting concentration of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone is actually higher than that of D-glucaro1,4;6,3-dilactone.

5.2.4 D-Glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone Plus One and a Half Equivalent DCl in Deuterium Oxide

The results from these experiment sets (Figures 5.19 and 5.20) were very similar to those from the sets with one molar equivalent of DCl. The relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone rapidly dropped to its equilibrium level. The relative starting concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone was quite high and increased for the first few experiments and then remained steady for the rest of the experiment set. The relative concentration of D-glucaric acid was low at the start but it steadily rose for the first 20,000 seconds to reach an equilibrium concentration that was higher than that of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone. Again the relative concentration of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone started at a high level before rapidly increasing for the first few experiments then steadily decreasing until it reached its equilibrium concentration.

Like the experiment sets with D-glucaro-1,4-lactone as the starting species, the results obtained from the experiment sets with D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone as the stating species were very reproducible when the duplicate sets were compared to the original sets. Again the mass balance of all of the experiment sets, that included all four species, was found to be consistent.
D-Glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone was not stable in neutral solution with its relative

concentration dropping steadily throughout the experiment sets. The results from all of the experiment sets with added DCl were very similar. The addition of DCl caused the relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone to rapidly decrease and this species reached its relatively low equilibrium concentration within the first few experiments of each set. The starting relative concentration of
D-glucaro-1,4-lactone was quite high in all of the experiment sets with added

DCl. This relatively high starting concentration was also seen for D-glucaro-6,3lactone, in the sets that had data for this species. The starting concentration of Dglucaric acid however was relatively low. The probable cause of this is that Dglucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone can not directly convert to the acyclic acid and instead converts to one of the monolactones, each which can convert to the acid. At the beginning of each experiment set the relative concentration of D-glucaro-6,3lactone rises rapidly before decreasing steadily to an equilibration concentration that is less than that of D-glucaric acid and slightly less than that of D-glucaro1,4-lactone. The relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone rose in the first few experiments before reaching its equilibration concentration, whereas the relative concentration of D-glucaric acid rises steadily for the first 20,000 seconds.

6.1 The MATLAB Program
MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory) is a software package for numerical computation and visualisation135. The built in functions provide many useful tools for kinetic simulations of chemical data. Script files can be written to solve ordinary differential equations (as well as other mathematical equations) that would be near impossible to solve manually. A set of differential equations with estimates of the rate constants involved can be used to simulate chemical reactions. Although the kinetic modelling program Gepasi was investigated, MATLAB was deemed to be more user-friendly than Gepasi.

6.2 Defining the Current Situation
Before any script file is produced it is vital to define the situation that one is describing. This includes labelling each reaction that is involved and applying a rate constant label to each. Also each species is assigned a number. From this a set of differential equations can be created to describe the situation.

6.2.1 Proposal of a Mechanism

Before differential equations and hence rate constants can be defined, it is essential to propose a mechanism for the reaction. Based on what is known about the equilibrium of aqueous D-glucaric acid, a list of equations describing the possible transformations that happen during the equilibration process was formed:

However when working in acidic solution it is likely that the starting species undergoes a pre-equilibrium step in which it becomes protonated:

StartingSpeciesH+

kx Product

Therefore the rate of change of the product is given by:
d[Product] = k x [ StartingSpeciesH + ] dt = k x K [ StartingSpecies][ H + ]

The equilibrium constant K is given by:
K= [StartingSpeciesH + ] [StartingSpecies][H + ]

Therefore: [ StartingSpeciesH + ] = K [ StartingSpecies][ H + ]

In the experiment sets that were used for kinetic analysis at least one molar equivalent of

was

added.

This

means

that

[StartingSpeciesH ]>>>[StartingSpecies]. By keeping the temperature constant

(the NMR spectrometer has a thermostat) K is kept constant. As the concentration of DCl in each experiment set it is kept constant it is reasonable to

Chapter Six ­ Kinetic Analysis

87

assume that [StartingSpeciesH+] is directly proportional to [StartingSpecies]. This assumption allows the following to be correct:

d[Product] = k x [ StartingSpecies] dt This allows the reactions of the equilibration of aqueous D-glucaric acid to interpreted as pseudo-first order. This simplifies the analysis and prevents the need to determine absolute concentrations of the species.

6.2.2 Assignment of Rate Constants

Each step in the mechanism is assigned a rate constant. The present equilibrium of aqueous D-glucaric acid is a rather complicated situation as there are eight equations involved, and these reactions are strongly related to one another. Each reaction has a rate constant that has to be evaluated from experimental data before being refined via MATLAB simulation (Figure 6.1).

6.3 Writing the Differential Equations
The rate constants must be used to create the differential equations that one ultimately wishes to use MATLAB to solve. These equations must first be derived from the mechanism before being converted to a format that MATLAB can use.

6.3.1 Creating the Differential Equations from the Assignment of Rate Constants

The following are the differential equations, based on the above assignment of rate constants, before they were converted to the correct form for MATLAB): d[D-glucaric Acid]/dt = k1[D-glucaro-1,4-lactone] - k2[D-glucaric Acid] - k3[Dglucaric Acid] + k4[D-glucaro-6,3-lactone] d[D-glucaro-1,4-lactone]/dt = -k1[D-glucaro-1,4-lactone] + k2[D-glucaric Acid] + k7[D-glucaro-1;46,3-dilactone]- k8[ D-glucaro-1,4-lactone] d[D-glucaro-6,3-lactone]/dt= k3 [D-glucaric Acid] - k4[D-glucaro-6,3-lactone] k5 [D-glucaro-6,3-lactone] + k6[D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone]; d[D-glucaro-1;4;6,3-dilactone]/dt = k5[D-glucaro-6,3-lactone ]- k6[D-glucaro1;46,3-dilactone]- k7[D-glucaro-1;46,3-dilactone]+ k8[ D-glucaro-1,4-lactone]

6.3.2 Converting the Differential Equations to a Suitable Form for MATLAB

The differential equations that one wishes MATLAB to solve must be written in the correct form for MATLAB to recognise. This includes using numbers in brackets for species labels and asterisks for multiply signs. For the purposes of this script the following labels were used: (1) = D-glucaric Acid (2) = D-glucaro-1,4-lactone

Chapter Six ­ Kinetic Analysis (3) = D-glucaro-6,3-lactone (4) = D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone

89

A semi colon is used at the end of each line that you do not want MATLAB to calculate separately and a % is used to designate text one wants MATLAB to ignore i.e. text labels. The following are the differential equations in the correct form for the aqueous
D-glucaric acid equilibrium:

dy(1) = k1*y(2) - k2*y(1) - k3*y(1) + k4*y(3); dy(2) = -k1*y(2) + k2*y(1) + k7*y(4) - k8*y(2); dy(3) = k3*y(1) - k4*y(3) - k5*y(3) + k6*y(4); dy(4) = k5*y(3) - k6*y(4) - k7*y(4) + k8*y(2)

6.4 Writing the Script File
After the differential equations have been written, the next step is writing a MATLAB script file (M-file). A script file contains a set of valid MATLAB commands that can be executed simply by typing the name of the file into the MATLAB command line. It is the equivalent of typing all the commands the script file contains one by one135. Writing such a file could be near impossible if one is not intimately aware of the workings of MATLAB. It is extremely fortunate therefore, that with the current situation, the enthusiastic and very patient assistance of Professor Richard J. Field from the University of Montana was available. Professor Field has had extensive experience with chemical kinetics and modelling, and was jointly responsible for the development of the Oregonator model of the BelousovZhabotinskii reaction136. With Professor Field's assistance and the Oregonator model as a guide, it was possible after trial and error, to write the following script files. The arrows and brackets represent comments that do not actually occur in the actual script files but have been added to help explain how each script file is created.

This creates four subplots with the simulation for one of the species on each subplot

This labels the x-axis on each subplot with `Time" and labels each y-axis with the correct species' name

6.5 Customising the Script File for Each Reaction
Once the script file has been created and tested to ensure that it produces simulations that have approximately correct time scales (by including estimates of starting concentrations and rate constants), the next step is to customise it to fit the reactions that one wishes to model. In the above script file, x1-x4 represent the starting concentrations of D-glucaric acid (x1), D-glucaro-1,4-lactone(x2), Dglucaro-6,3-lactone(x3) and D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone(x4). The rate constant values (k1-k8) have been left empty in the above script file. Estimates of these rate constants (from experimental data) are added and these can be altered to improve the fit between simulated data and actual experimental data.

Chapter Six ­ Kinetic Analysis

93

By using the "xlsread" command in MATLAB it is possible to import experimental data from an Excel spreadsheet. This can then be plotted in MATLAB. The above plotting commands can be altered so that simulated data and the actual data can be plotted on the same graph.

6.6 Estimates of Rate Constants
The main aim of the simulation was to obtain good estimates of the eight rate constants involved in the equilibration of aqueous D-glucaric acid. To achieve this is was necessary to begin simulations with reasonable estimates of the rate constants for each reaction. Although literature was consulted137-140 in attempt to find rate constants that may relate to the current situation, it was decided that it would be more accurate to determine estimates of rate constants directly from the experimental data. As the reactions are pseudo first order, the resulting rate constants will have s-1 as units.

6.6.1 Determination of Equilibrium Constants

Determining the equilibrium constant for each set of reactions makes estimating the rate constants easier, as well as providing some useful stand-alone information. If the experimental data is consistent, the equilibrium constants obtained from the data from each set of experiments should be similar after experimental error is taken into account. The following shows the relationships that make determining equilibrium constants beneficial for making estimations of rate constants of the equilibration of D-glucaric acid:

After visual inspection of the Excel graphs plotted from the experimental data is was decided that equilibrium was reached at 80,000 seconds. Therefore the concentration of each species at the end of each set of experiments was used in the calculation of the equilibrium constants.

Table 6.1 Equilibrium constants from experimental data

Overall the equilibrium constants were very similar between experiment sets. This indicates that the data is accurate. The only equilibrium constants that deviated from what was expected was those (K3 and K4) involving the concentration of the D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone in the experiment sets with Dglucaro-1,4-lactone and one and a half molar equivalents of DCl. This is possibly due to the fact that 80,000 seconds is not long enough for the dilactone species to reach its equilibrium concentration in these experiment sets.

6.6.2 Use of Initial Growth and Decay Rates to Estimate Rate Constants

Estimations of rate constants can be made by calculating the initial growth and decay rates of a species. For a decaying species it is possible to get an estimate of

Chapter Six ­ Kinetic Analysis

96

the rate constant for the reaction causing its decay by dividing the initial rate of its decay by the average absolute concentration of the decaying species during the time the initial rate is determined. For a growing species, the rate constant for the growth reaction is obtained by dividing the initial rate of growth of the growing species by the absolute concentration of the species it is growing from. These assumptions are based on the fact that reverse reactions are unimportant in the initial stages of a reaction. Using data from the experiment sets that have D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone as the starting species, the initial growth rate of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone divided by the average concentration of the D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone (as the 6,3-lactone is growing from the dilactone initially) over this growth period produces an approximation of k6. Similar calculations can be made using the data for Dglucaro-1,4-lactone to yield an approximation of k7. The initial growth rate of Dglucaric acid can be used to estimate k4 when it is divided the average concentration of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone over this growth period. By examining the graphs of experimental data it is sensible to conclude that D-glucaric acid is initially growing from D-glucaro-6,3-lactone. This is why the concentration of Dglucaro-6,3-lactone falls away after a period of rapid rising. The data from the experiment sets that have D-glucaro-1,4-lactone as the starting species can be used in a similar way to produce an estimate of k1 (from both the initial growth rate of D-glucaric acid divided by the average concentration of Dglucaro-1,4-lactone and from the initial decay rate of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone divided by its average concentration over this period). An estimate of k3 can be obtained by dividing the initial growth rate of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone by the average concentration of D-glucaric acid over this period, because of reasons similar to those discussed above. As the equilibrium constant of a reaction represents the ratio of the rate constants for the forward and reverse reaction, it is possible to derive estimates of rate constants for those reactions that initial growth and decay calculations cannot produce. For the current situation it is possible to gain estimations of k1, k3, k4, k6

Chapter Six ­ Kinetic Analysis

97

and k7 from the experimental data. By using the calculated equilibrium constants above it was possible to calculate estimates of k2, k3, k4, k5 and k8. The estimates were done per experiment set, using the equilibrium constants for that set. The results for the experiments that had D-glucaro-1,4-lactone as the starting species are shown (Table 6.2), as are the results for the experiments starting with D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone as the starting species (Table 6.3).

When the estimations of rate constants were compared there were no general differences between those estimated from experiment sets with one molar equivalent of DCl and those experiment sets with one and a half molar equivalents of DCl. Although acidity often affects rate constants, when one looks at the mechanism proposed above it is apparent that one molar equivalent of DCl would convert all of the starting species into its protonated form. Therefore one and a half molar equivalents of DCl represents a small excess and may not systematically affect the rate constants. Therefore values from all experiment sets were used to produce average estimations of the eight rate constants (Table 6.4).

6.6.3 Starting Set of Rate Constants for Simulations

When the set of estimated rate constants obtained from the initial growth and decay rates was examined it was found that the product of the equilibrium constants (K1K2K3K4) when these estimated rate constants were used to produce the equilibrium constants was no longer equal to one. This is due to the fact that the calculated equilibrium constants for each experiment set were used to calculate those rate constants that could not be calculated from experimental data for that set. This method produces a more accurate estimation of a particular rate constant for a particular experiment set. However because average equilibrium constants were not used, the small differences between the calculated equilibrium constants (due to experimental error) for each experiment set produce the discrepancy seen in the product of the equilibrium constants produced with the averaged rate constants. It is very fundamental that the sum of the equilibrium constants equals one; therefore it is necessary to alter one of the rate constants to ensure this. Experimental noise is more significant in smaller equilibrium constants therefore inspection of the calculated equilibrium constants suggested that the rate constants that produce K3 should be altered so that the product of the equilibrium constants was indeed one. K3 represents the ratio of k5 and k6 and its calculated value is considerably lower than the other calculated equilibrium constants. By changing k5 from 6.967e-5 to 1.742e-5, the product of the

Chapter Six ­ Kinetic Analysis

100

equilibrium constants formed by using the estimations of the rate constants is 1.07. This set of rate constants could now be used for simulations (Table 6.5). Rate Constant k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 k6 k7 k8 Rate Constants for First

6.7 MATLAB Simulations
6.7.1 Evaluation of Initial Set of Rate Constants

The above set of rate constants was entered in the appropriate place in the MATLAB script file. Separate script files were created for each experiment set. The actual starting concentrations of the species in each experiment set were entered into the correct script file. Simulations were run and the results were first plotted using the plotting commands detailed above so that each species graph was represented on a subplot. This allowed the simulation of each species to be evaluated individually. The plotting commands were then altered so that actual data and simulated data were plotted on the same graph. This allowed comparison between the simulation and actual experimental data, and the closeness of fit between the two could be evaluated. A key is provided (Figure
6.2) Although this set of rate constants produced relatively good fits for the

experiment sets that had D-glucaro-1,4-lactone as the starting species (Figure
6.3), the fits produced for the experiment sets that had D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-

dilactone as the starting species (Figure 6.4) were not as good. In these experiment sets, the simulations failed to produce that rapid rise then decay of D-

6.7.2 Systematic Alteration of Rate Constants

To obtain an insight into how the rate constants affected the simulation, each pair of rate constants was systematically increased by 25% and decreased by 25%, and the results were plotted. By altering each pair of rate constants by the same amount the ratio (that was obtained from experimental data) was not changed and neither was the product of the resulting equilibrium constants. This process was extremely time consuming, and efficient records were needed to ensure that one did not become lost and end up making changes that altered the ratios of the pairs of rate constants. It was essential also that the first set of rate constants was kept as a reference point to go back to if the fits became worse than the original starting point

Chapter Six ­ Kinetic Analysis
6.7.3 Trial and Error

103

The systematic series of increasing and decreasing the rate constants provided a base for trial and error changes. By combining these results with intuition, trial and error changes were made in attempt to improve the fits. Fitting a fourparameter system is a challenging proposition, especially when things are as strongly coupled as in this system. Therefore a lot of patience and perseverance was needed. Simulations are very sensitive to the equilibrium and rate constant values chosen, therefore minor changes can sometimes change the shape of the simulated graph completely.

6.8 Final Rate Constants and Simulations
After a considerable amount of work a final set of rate constants was arrived at. This set maintained the previous ratios, produced equilibrium constants that had a product of 1.08 and produced simulations that had good fits (Table 6.6).

Table 6.6 Final set of rate constants at 27°C

This set of rate constants captured the sharp peak of the rapid rise then decay of the D-glucaro-6,3-lactone, as well as producing good fits for the other species. Although it is relatively easy to fit a set of rate constants to an individual experiment, the challenge comes when that same set of rate constants used to simulate data that has come from quite different experiments. This is the case in the current situation as the different starting species produce very different graphs. This set of rate constants interprets well four sets of data from quite

6.9 Discussion and Sources of Errors
Although the final set of rate constants produced satisfactory fits for most of the data, the simulations of two experiment sets did not closely fit the experimental data for D-glucaro-6,3-lactone. When the D-Glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone plus DCl duplicate and the D-Glucaro1,4;6,3-dilactone plus one and a half Equivalent DCl duplicate experiment sets were simulated, the shape of the simulated line for D-glucaro-6,3-lactone did not match the line for the actual experimental data. As stated section 5.3 it was found that the concentration of the D-glucaro-6,3-lactone was actually higher than the concentration of the D-Glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone at the start of these experiment sets. Clearly this should not be the case as when one starts out with D-Glucaro1,4;6,3-dilactone it is expected that this species will have the highest relative concentration at the start of the experiment set. This is an indication of how fast the D-Glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone decomposes in aqueous acidic solution. The results from these two experiment sets suggest that there has been a slightly longer delay between sample preparation and the middle of the first experiment in these experiment sets compared to all of the other sets. This means that the experimental starting concentrations for these experiment sets are actually the concentrations after more equilibration has occurred than in the other sets. It was decided that, because of this error, these two experiment sets would not be included in the kinetic analysis. Trying to fit the rate constants to these sets may cause the set of rate constants to not produce good fits for the rest of the data. Overall the fits between the simulated and actual data of the remaining experiment sets are very close. It would not be possible to match the simulated data exactly with the experimental data due to the errors involved with this type of calculation. There is experimental error involved in the calculation of the equilibrium constants that the rate constants are constrained by. There is also error in the actual experimental data. Ignoring the differences in acidity may also introduce error.

Chapter Six ­ Kinetic Analysis

109

Although it is possible to use the final set of rate constants to "back-calculate" experimental equilibrium constants, given that the equilibrium constants from each experimental set were used to produce the ratios used to constrain the rate constants and the rate constants were averaged, back-calculation will only produce an estimate of the experimental equilibrium constant. As the value of k5 was altered to ensure that the product of the equilibrium constants produced from the rate constants equalled one, K3 can not be calculated via back-calculation. As the simulated date and the actual experimental data fit it is likely that the proposed mechanism and the final set of rate constants are feasible. However as with any simulations, the discovery of a set of rate constants that simulates the proposed mechanism correctly may be due to chance rather than the mechanism and rate constants being accurate.

Chapter Seven ­ Conclusions and Further Work

7.1 General Conclusions
The development of the 1H NMR spectroscopy method allowed the kinetics of the equilibration of aqueous D-glucaric acid to be investigated. The Bruker Multi_zgvd program allowed delays to occur between 1H NMR experiments, which allowed 100 NMR experiments to be run on the same sample without having to manually set up each experiment. The use of DMSO as an internal standard provided a convenient method of describing the relative concentrations of the four species. Manual processing and integration, although time consuming, provided precise data that contributed to the reproducibility between original and duplicate sets.

7.2 Summary of Results
Under neutral conditions D-glucaro-1,4-lactone was relatively stable against equilibration. This agreed with previous work11. In acidic conditions D-glucaro1,4-lactone decomposed to its relative equilibrium concentration while the relative concentrations of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone (in those experiment sets with this data) and D-glucaric acid increased to their equilibrium concentrations. When D-glucaro-1,4-lactone was the starting species, the relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone remained low. The rate of ring-closing of the 1,4lactone must be comparative to its ring opening as D-glucaro-1,4-lactone formed and had a relative equilibrium concentration that was slightly higher than that of
D-glucaro-6,3-lactone(under acidic conditions). When k1 and k2 were compared

it was found that they are of similar size.
D-Glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone was unstable

equilibrated. Under acidic conditions this equilibration was even more rapid and

111

its relative concentration dropped to its low equilibrium concentration within the first few experiments. The relative concentration of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone increased rapidly then steadily decreased to its equilibrium concentration when
D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone was the starting species. The relative concentration

of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone steadily increased until it reached its equilibrium concentration.

7.3 Comparison of Results with Reported Work
As a final set of rate constants were produced, previous qualitative work can be compared to the quantitative data produced. The equilibrium (Figure 7.1) and set of final set of rate constants (Table 7.1) are included for clarity.

Table 7.1 Final set of rate constants at 27°C

It was reported that the reciprocal transformation between the monolactones was caused via the free dicarboxylic acid pathway, and not the dilactone11. The results from the experiment sets with D-glucaro-1,4-lactone confirm this. The relative concentration of D-glucaric acid rose to its equilibrium concentration but the relative concentration of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone remained at a low level. Therefore it is possible for D-glucaro-6,3-lactone to form from the relatively high concentration of D-glucaric acid present while it is unlikely to form from the relatively low amount of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone. The fast mutarotation of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone was reported to be due to the instability of the 1,4-lactone ring in aqueous solution10. Opening of the 1,4lactone ring would rapidly produce the 6,3-lactone. This is what is seen in the experiment sets with D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone as the starting material. The relative starting concentration of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone is high (in some sets higher than that of D-glucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone) and this rapidly increased over the first few experiments. This result indicates that k6 is large. In fact k6 is by far the largest rate constant and is approximately10-100 times larger than the other rate constants. Previous work under neutral conditions, found that D-glucaric acid lactonised to give the 6,3-lactone spontaneously as the first product but 1,4 formed more slowly12. This would suggest that k3 is larger than k1. However when k1 and

Chapter Seven ­ Conclusions and Further Work

113

k3.are compared it is found that they are similar sizes. This may be because that k1 and k3 relate to acidic conditions, and under neutral conditions it is highly likely that the values for these rate constants would be different. Kiely et. al. reported that the ring opening of the 1,4-lactone ester and 1,4lactone amide was faster than the ring opening of the corresponding 6,3-lactone ester and 6,3-lactone amide, when the monolactones were reacted with npropylamine (i.e. under alkaline conditions)73. A similar result was reported when the transesterification (at 90°C and under anhydrous conditions) of Dglucaro-1,4;6,3-dilactone produced 50% more of the product that required ring opening of the 1,4-lactone than the product that required the opening of the 6,3lactone130. These results imply that k6 is larger than k7. This is what is found with k6 being approximately 10 times larger than k7. Previous work investigating the equilibration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone and Dglucaro-6,3-lactone reported that under acidic conditions (2N sulphuric acid or excess cation exchange resin) both monolactones had similar equilibrium concentrations11. This is different to the experimental results which found the relative equilibrium concentration of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone to be slightly higher than its D-glucaro-6,3- counterpart. However this work also investigated the relative equilibrium conditions of the monolactones under neutral conditions and found that the relative concentration of D-glucaro-6,3-lactone was higher than that of D-glucaro-1,4-lactone. This result indicates how the relative equilibrium concentrations of the species can change with different conditions. Although it is useful to compare the current experimental results with results from similar investigations, it is important to note that no reports from the literature have the same conditions as the current experimental results. As kinetic results are very dependant on conditions such as temperature and pH, it is impossible to correlate results from experiments that do not have identical conditions.

7.4 Evaluation of Mechanism
The proposed mechanism and final set of rate constants provided good fits between actual experimental data and the simulated data, which suggested that these were correct. The equilibrium constants calculated from the experimental data provided useful information for the simulations as well as providing applicable information on the equilibration of aqueous D-glucaric acid.

7.5 Further Work
Further work that is possible includes investigation of the equilibration under alkaline conditions and when the other two species (D-glucaric acid and Dglucaro-6,3-lactone )are used as starting species. The equilibration under alkaline conditions would be particularly useful as after the aqueous D-glucaric acid is esterified with an acid catalyst it is reacted with an amine; hence it is subjected to alkaline conditions. Overall this work represents a thorough investigation into some of the aspects of the equilibration of D-glucaric acid in aqueous solution. The results will be applicable to the production of poly(D-glucaramides) both as background information on the equilibrium of aqueous D-glucaric acid and more directly when activated
