Literature Review

2.1

Legislation

There are two approaches to addressing the problem of alcohol and drug use while driving; the impairment and per se approaches [1,2]. Table 1 describes these different approaches.

Table 1. Description of the possible approaches to the legislation on alcohol and drugs and driving [1,2]
Approach Description Advantages Disadvantages

No research on the effects of individual drugs is necessary as it applies for general drug use Based on Driver performance as determined by field impairment tests. The concentration of drugs in blood is irrelevant in this case. It was the first legislation applied to alcohol use. Blood or urine analysis only confirms the presence of drugs and provides a possible explanation for the impairment. Legally, this approach does not obstruct constitutional rights.

Impairment

Convictions can become difficult since the assessment of impairment depends on the ability of Police officers and/or doctors to identify impaired drivers (subjective determination of impairment even though criteria are used). Development of tolerance in drivers becomes a problem (drivers might not look impaired but their driving performance might be affected). Hospitalised drivers can not be tested for impairment

9 Table 1 continued
Approach Description Advantages Disadvantages

An offence is committed if drugs are detected above the legal limit. Driving performance is irrelevant in this case. In the case of the zero-limit approach, chosen by countries that do not believe that drug concentrations reflect impairment (as for alcohol), just the presence of substances is enough for a conviction to be entered. There is no legal limit.

Concentrations of alcohol and/or drugs are easier to prove than impairment and therefore, convictions are easier to bring. Its execution is easy and it is simple to apply. Under zero-limit legislation, the driver is encouraged to avoid drug use prior to driving.

Concentration limits (as for alcohol) do not relate to individual impairment levels. Analytical cut-offs are usually set. For zero-limit approaches, a scientific proof of the deleterious effects of drugs on driving skills, even at small concentrations might be needed. Generally concentration limits are imposed for only a small number of (illicit) drugs.

Per se

There are two possible ways to execute these regulations: under the administrative or the criminal (prosecution by the order of courts) laws [1].

Legislation in New Zealand

Presently, there is no specific legislation for the use of individual drugs (other than alcohol) and driving in this country. The current legislation on this matter textually states [4]: "A person commits an offence if the person drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a road while under the influence of drink or a drug, or both, to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle." "If a person is convicted of a first or second offence against subsection 1 (previous point), the maximum penalty is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or a fine not exceeding $4,500; and the court must order the person to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver licence for 6 months or more." "If a person commits a third or subsequent offence against subsection 1... the person commits an indictable offence and on conviction. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or a fine not exceeding $6,000; and the court must order the person to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver licence for more than 1 year."

12 "A person commits an indictable offence if the person is in charge of a motor vehicle ... and causes bodily injury to or the death of a person while the person in charge is under the influence of drink or a drug, or both, to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle... The maximum penalty is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or a fine not exceeding $20,000; and the court must order the person to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver licence for 1 year or more in the case of a first or second offence." "A person may not drive or attempt to drive a motor vehicle ... while the proportion of alcohol in the person's breath, as ascertained by an evidential breath test ... exceeds 400 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath; or the proportion of alcohol in the person's blood, as ascertained from an analysis of a blood specimen... exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood; or If the person is younger than 20, the proportion of alcohol in the person's breath, as ascertained by an evidential breath test... exceeds 150 micrograms of alcohol per litre of breath; or the proportion of alcohol in the person's blood, as ascertained from an analysis of a blood specimen... exceeds 30 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood."

Some of the most important and relevant traffic legislation, enacted in New Zealand is shown in Table 4.

Drug Use

Information on the prevalence of drugs in different sectors of the population can be collected through the use of different methodologies. Data collection might involve surveys (questionnaires or interviews) applied to the general population or subsets of the population. 2.2.1 Efforts International from countries worldwide have lead to a better

understanding of their drug situation in terms of prevalence. The United Nations, reported in 2004 some statistics related to drug use in different countries [6]. A summary of a selection of

14 these is shown in Table 5, giving the percentage of the population between 15 and 64 years old using these drugs.

Other organisations and programs such as the Global Road Safety Partnership (GRSP), The Transport Research Laboratory (TRL Limited) in the United Kingdom, The ROSITA (RoadSide Testing Assessment) project organised by the European Union, The European Observatory of Drugs and Toxicomany, among others, are also involved in collecting, analysing and presenting data in relation to this issue. Results of studies on drug use in relation to the driving population in some European countries, developing countries, Australia and Canada are as follows: The prevalence of illicit drugs in Europe in the general driving population is 1-5% and in drivers involved in collisions is 10-25%. The prevalence of licit drugs in the first group is higher, 5-15%, than illicit drug use and licit

16 drug use in drivers involved in collisions is reported as 621% [1,7]. Two hundred and ninety three drivers stopped on the road in The Netherlands (1997-1998), showed an incidence of alcohol use of 12.3%. Cannabis was present in 5.1% of the drivers, amphetamines and opiates in the same proportion (1.4%) and cocaine in 0.68% [1]. In Belgium, 2053 samples collected from injured or deceased drivers from 1995 to 1996, showed a high occurrence of alcohol (27%), followed by benzodiazepines (8.5%), opiates (7.5%), cannabinoids (6.0%) and amphetamines (3.0%) [1]. A study of 9772 drivers involved in fatal crashes in France, revealed 2096 positive cases for alcohol use (21.4%), 681 positive cases for cannabis in a concentration higher or equal to 1 ng/mL (7.0%) and 285 positive cases for the combination alcohol-cannabis (2.9%) [8]. In Norway (1994), 2529 blood samples from drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs were tested for drugs. Of these, 59% were positive for drugs use with 30% alcohol only. The most prevalent drugs were benzodiazepines (30.6%), cannabinoids (26.1%) and amphetamines (21.1%) [2]. Prevalence of drugs in 3398 fatally injured drivers in Australia (Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales) was studied overa period of nine years (19901999). Important findings were: 26.7% positive cases for

17 drug use (other than alcohol), 13.5% of which correspond to cannabis, 4.9% to opioids, 4.1% equally to stimulants and benzodiazepines [9]. Roadside surveys conducted in Quebec in 1999 and 2000 indicated that 11.8% of the urine samples taken had drugs other then alcohol. The most prevalent drug was cannabis (6.7%), followed by benzodiazepines (3.6%), opiates (1.2%) and cocaine (1.1%) [7]. Very few studies on drugs and driving have been carried out in Africa, however a roadside survey conducted in Kenya (1997), in which 479 drivers were tested for alcohol by breath devices showed 19.9% of the cases as being positive for alcohol (8.3% > 0.5g/L and 4% > 0.8 g/L); all drunk drivers were male older than 25 years old [10]. Likewise, there is not much information on the drugs and driving situation in South America. Colombia reported 34% of fatally injured drivers had used alcohol. In Argentina, 83% of drivers surveyed self-reported that they drove under the influence of alcohol [10]. 2.2.2 In New Zealand

A chronological account of studies conducted in New Zealand, reflecting different aspects of the drugs situation in the country is presented below. Table 5 also shows some comparative statistics of drug use in New Zealand in relation to other countries in the world. The first study performed in this country intending to analyse the role of drugs (other than alcohol) in car accidents, was the

18 Waikato Hospital Road Accident Survey (1979/80) [11]. Some results of this survey are: Of the 822 injured drivers tested for cannabis, 7.2% were positive for it (radioimmunoassay). However there was no proof of impairment by cannabis at the moment of the accidents. Confirmation techniques were not carried out. Only one driver of the 901 included in the survey was said to be impaired with a prescription drug (single use). In two other drivers, the prescribed drugs might have increased the adverse effects of alcohol. 17% of the drivers tested positive for alcohol at a concentration higher than 80 mg/100mL. A research paper published in 1995 about alcohol and fatal road crashes that occurred between 1991 and 1993 [12], used data sources including ESR's post-mortem and blood alcohol data, and Coroners' reports. Important findings are as follows: Of the total number of cases studied, 450 were positive for alcohol and 757 negative. 60% of the drivers (positive for alcohol) had blood alcohol levels higher than 150 mg/ 100 mL. Fatal accidents involving alcohol occurred more often from 9.00 pm to 5.00 am.

19 The role of cannabis in fatal road accidents was studied in a sample of 386 fatally injured drivers, over a two year period [13]. Important results and conclusions were reached: 41% of the drivers were positive for alcohol and 21% for THC. About 67% of the drivers who tested positive for cannabis also had alcohol in blood. This combination was more prevalent than cannabis use alone. There seems to be a clear relationship between cannabis use and excessive use of alcohol. The blood levels of alcohol found in drivers who used the combination of drugs were on average higher than the levels of drivers who used alcohol alone. Therefore, a pattern of social behaviour can be suggested. An article published by the New Zealand Medical Journal in 1998 [14], mentions some anecdotal and research evidence related to the cultivation and production of cannabis. The climate and geographic conditions of this country have permitted the easy cultivation of the marijuana plant to the point that the importations are minimal. the supply of cannabis It is also said that in-house became a means of economical hydroponic cultivations are camouflaged in legal businesses, and subsistence for some Maori communities living in rural areas. Several birth cohorts have been studied in New Zealand [15]. One of the most recent ones, aimed at linking cannabis use and risk of car accidents [16], gathered data from 907 young New Zealanders (born in Christchurch) aged 21 who had driven

20 vehicles since age 18. A statistically significant association between reported car accidents and cannabis use was found. The risk rate was 1.6 times higher for cannabis users than for nonusers, the risk was related to the behavioural characteristics of young cannabis users rather than impairment due to cannabis use itself. The New Zealand drug statistics published in 2001, collected data from surveys and event-based statistics (like hospital records of drug use). The report showed alcohol as the most used recreational drug in the country followed by tobacco and cannabis [17]. The most recent statistics on this topic were reported in the 2002/03 New Zealand Health Survey [18]: 83.5% of the people surveyed had drunk an alcoholic beverage in the preceding 12 months. 19.1% of the people aged 15 years old or more had a drinking pattern that represented risk of physical or mental damage in the future (hazardous drinking). Of these, 27.1% were men and 11.7% women. One in seven adults surveyed, admitted having use marijuana (smoked) the year previous to the survey. 1 in 19 smoked it on a regular basis. In 2004, 12% of injury crashes and 30% of fatal crashes involved alcohol and/or drug use [5].

21 2.3 Studies

The worldwide problem of drugs use has lead to governments developing laws that attempt to reduce the incidence of drugrelated road crashes. These laws are most of the time based on studies that reveal the prevalence and effects of legal and illegal drugs, and their combinations, and the responsibility of these drugs in road crashes. There are two possible situations in which the studies can be conducted: In the field (epidemiological studies involving culpability analysis, prevalence of drugs in crashes, case-control studies) and in the laboratory (experimental studies involving driving simulators, on-the-road driving tests and psychomotor tests) [19,20]. The approaches used by researchers who aim to establish a possible relationship (in terms of responsibility) between cannabis or other psychoactive drugs and the risk of motor vehicle accidents, are reviewed below.

2.3.1

Driving approach

simulator

and

On-the-road

studies

Analysis of the skills necessary for a good standard of driving performance (vigilance, perception of speed and risks, etc.) can be executed through psychomotor tests, the use of a simulator or real driving studies [21]. In the case of the simulator, the computer generates a setting imitating real driving conditions with the possibility for researchers to include sudden situations or obstacles [21]. A

22 problem associated with this kind of test is the lack of realism present in actual driving circumstances [20]. Some irregularities have been reported when analysing cannabis use in driving simulators: increase of the lateral position variability, as well as reaction time, decision taking, and traffic signs and navigational information are ignored [20,21]. However, manifestations that partially compensate for the impairment have also been observed: a longer distance is maintained when following cars and a general tendency to drive slowly [20]. On-the-road studies can be performed on closed circuits or controlled driving on public roads. Problems related to this kind of study are generally ethical; the quantities of cannabis (or other drugs of interest) given to the participants are controlled and might not represent real use cases. The average dose to get a "high" with this drug oscillates in the order of 300 g/Kg [20,21]. Researches have shown that severe driving impairment was present when cannabis was combined with low doses of alcohol (BAC < 50 mg / 100 mL) in "road tracking tests", "car following" and "city driving" tests [20]. 2.3.2 Case-control study approach

Case-control studies are epidemiological studies that tend to involve a demonstrative and comparable control group [20], that will match the case group (injured or fatally injured drivers) in terms of time and location (same place, same day of the week, hour, etc, weeks after the accident) [22].

23 A problem found with this kind of study (at least for cannabis analysis) is the lack of devices for the easy identification of drugs at the roadside. Ethical issues associated with the sample (blood) collection arise for the control group [22]. A good example would be a prospective case-control study performed in The Netherlands (May 2000 ­ August 2001), intended to evaluate the association between the use of psychoactive drugs and car crashes where hospitalisation was required [23]. Details and results (statistically significant) of this study are presented below. The case group was car or van drivers involved in a vehicle accident, from whom blood and/or urine samples were taken at the hospital. The control group was drivers randomly chosen from public roads at different times of the day and days of the week and who voluntarily gave a urine or blood sample and responded to an interview. The risk for car accidents after single use of

benzodiazepines was 5.1 times higher than for the control group. In the case of alcohol the odds ratio was O.R: 5.5 (BAC= 50-79 mg/100 mL) and O.R: 15.5 (BAC  80 mg/100 mL). Cases when a combination of drugs (other than alcohol) were involved, gave a high odds ratio of 6.1. Drivers who used a combination of alcohol and other drugs had an extremely high odds ratio of 112.2.

24 No increased risk of car accidents was found for drivers who used cannabis. 2.3.3 Culpability or Responsibility study approach

Culpability studies are epidemiological studies, that can be considered as case-case studies (both groups have been involved in motor vehicle crashes) [22]. After evaluation of the responsibility for the drivers on the accident (without prior knowledge of the involvement of drugs), the not culpable group is assigned as the equivalent to the control group (for calculations). The odds ratio of drivers with no evidence of drug use is assumed 1.0 [20]. Problems related to this approach arise from the lack of statistical power associated to the size of the sample under study [20]. Drummer et al carried out an important 10-year responsibility study in three Australian states [9]. Details and results of this study are shown below. All possible factors that might contribute to car accidents were taken into account for culpability scoring purposes. Drivers were divided into three groups, depending on the culpability score: culpable, contributory and non-culpable (a more detailed description of the methodology used can be found in Chapter 4, Study 2). model. Of the 3398 fatally injured drivers, 1704 were drugs-free (control group) and 1694 were positive for drugs (case Statistically significant interactions were analysed by using a logistic regression

25 group). Of the control group, 1214 drivers were culpable of the accident and 376 were not culpable (114 contributory), likewise, 1487 drivers from the case group were culpable and 133 not culpable (74 contributory). Cannabis use was found to be associated with culpability. The risk of having a car accident after using cannabis was 2.7 times higher than for the control group. Results also suggested that cannabis enhanced the

impairment caused by alcohol. The culpability odds of drivers with THC and alcohol ( 50 mg/100 mL) was 2.9 times the odds of drivers who had the same alcohol levels alone.

Because of its unique pattern of effects, classification of this drug as either sedative, stimulant or hallucinogen is difficult

Used medically for the treatment of anorexia in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting related to cancer therapy

Effects depend on the dose, the administration route, the experience of the user, between others. General effects include: euphoria, relaxation, sense of well being, lack of expression, altered memory and learning, sedation, panic, and paranoia.

Study 1

Study 1 is intended to determine the proportion of drinking drivers that test positive for drugs other than alcohol. Under the current legislation for drink-driving in New Zealand, drivers are asked to undertake alcohol breath tests (passive breath test, breath screening test and evidential breath test). These tests are performed through different devices that screen and confirm the presence of alcohol and the concentrations; evidential breath test results are used in court as evidence. Drivers also have the option to submit a blood sample for testing or not. Blood tests are conclusive proof of alcohol intake in levels exceeding the legal limits 3 [1]. Therefore, not all drivers found to have high levels of alcohol (compared to the limits) submit a blood sample.

3.1 Materials
3.1.1 The Population population studied was drivers stopped for roadside

screening of alcohol who had breath alcohol concentrations above the legal limit and provided evidential blood alcohol samples. This population does not completely represent the general driving cluster (approx. 2,997,494 licensed drivers 4 [2]) but the uninjured drink driving population who were apprehended and provided a blood sample.
" No matter what the result of a breath test, a driver has the right to request a blood sample". The Land Transport Amendment Act, 2001 [1]. 4 Current and limited licence holders (30/04/2006) not including drivers with international licenses [2].

32

In the fiscal year 2004-2005, there were approximately 26,036 positive cases of breath screening tests and 26,519 charges for alcohol offences [3]. 3.1.2 Samples

A set of 2000 blood samples was randomly selected from the pool of roadside samples taken by the police in a time period of about 1 year. Acceptance criteria for the inclusion of samples in this study are: Circumstances: drivers (uninjured) who gave positive test results and opted for a blood test.

3.2 Methodology
3.2.1 Analytical methodology

The blood samples were screened for the possible presence of drugs. The screening technique used was ELISA, where the analyte in the sample, competes with the enzyme labeled antigen (drug derivative) for a limited and constant number of antibody units attached to the polystyrene micro-plates. The colour that develops after the addition of the chromogenic substrate is monitored at 450 nm. This screening method has been widely used in forensic science and other sciences since the 1970s [4]. It is consider sensitive, very simple and useful in terms of cost-effectivity [5,6]. Crossreactivity, although an issue in immunoassays, does not prevent their broaden use, as long as it is determined and known.

33

The alcohol concentration was determined in duplicate by an ESR staff member using GC-FID headspace chromatography. Table 7 lists the drug tests performed and relevant parameters of the kits according to the manufacturer [7-10]. The cut-off standard used in the laboratory is also included in this Table. The reagents, equipment and methodology used are shown in detail in Appendices 2 and 3. In this study, only preliminary test results (positive or negative) were used to give an idea of the incidence of drugs within the drink-driver population. No confirmatory techniques were involved since only group of drugs were target (confirmatory techniques are used to verify the presence of specific drugs and/or metabolites).

Accuracy determined in terms of percentage of positive and negative samples (confirmed by other technique) that tested positive and negative respectively by ELISA. Based on the minimum amount to produce a deviation of 4 sd (standard deviations) [9].

In terms of specificity of the kits used, cross-reactivity with related drugs permitted the determination of the groups of drugs targeted: D-L-methamphetamine, important cross-reactivity is seen with D,L-MDMA. For morphine, the kit detects codeine in addition to morphine. In the group of benzodiazepines, alprazolam, estazolam, diazepam, nordiazepam and -OH alprazolam are detected, however, low doses of some benzodiazepines might not be detected and so underestimation of the total amount of positive cases (for individual and multiple drug use) might occur. The cannabis kit detects 11-nor-9-carboxy-8-THC, 9-THC and 8-THC. On the other hand, none unrelated drugs (acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, ibuprofen and some other drugs of

35 abuse or prescription such as cocaine, methadone) give results greater or equal to the sensitivity value.

3.2.2

Statistical methodology

A framework (Figure 1) for the collection of the sample was set at the beginning of the study, as the main objective of this part of the project was to gather information about the occurrence of drivers who in addition to alcohol consumption, use single or multiple drugs. The database provided by the Police, which included basic information such as self-reported occupation data (drivers, courier drivers, bus drivers etc.), age and gender, was crosscorrelated with the toxicology results from ESR (Table 8) by the project statistician to obtain statistical inferences on drug and alcohol use within driver categories. The analysis was performed using the Statistical Analysis Software System (SAS version 9.1). The incidence of drugs and alcohol within the driver population was then evaluated in terms of age range (15-19, 20-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-64, 65+ and unknown), gender (male, female, unknown), type of drugs, blood alcohol concentration ( 30 mg/100mL, 31-80 mg/100mL, 81-160 mg/100mL and  160 mg/mL) and commercial drivers. The percentage of drivers for each category was calculated from the total number of relevant cases (Appendix 4).

All the alcohol concentration results were statistically adjusted to take into account the uncertainty of the measure, in order to do this, six (three standard deviations) are always deducted from every concentration determined. This practice is especially important when concentrations fall within the legal limits, preventing false positives to occur and providing drivers with the benefit of the doubt.

3.3 Discussion and Results
General descriptive statistics of the 2000 samples analysed, led to important inferences about road users in New Zealand. The results however, are not completely representative of the general driving population, represent the uninjured drink driving population. 37% (741) of the 2000 cases tested positive for drugs (one or more). From these, 95% (705) screened positive for individual drug use in addition to alcohol and the remaining 5% (36) had multiple drugs in their blood.

38

3.3.1

General findings

Amongst drivers who had used a single drug (other than alcohol), cannabis was by far the most prevalent at 89.2% (661/741) of the positive cases. Important combinations of drugs seen were: and cannabis cannabis ­ ­

benzodiazepines

(2.8%,

21/741)

methamphetamines (1.6%, 12/741). Multiple drug consumption is dangerous, especially when experienced with alcohol. Strong adverse effects in terms of driving skills have been reported [1116]. A better picture of this problem might be reflected in the study of casualties and culpability analysis; Study 2 (Chapter 4). Out of the 2000 drivers who tested positive for alcohol, 35% (696) also had consumed cannabis, 2.9% (58) benzodiazepines, 1.1% (22) used methamphetamines and 0.15% (3) had used morphine or heroin. Figure 2 and 3 present the data for study 1 in a graphical way and the breakdown table summarizes it (Appendix 4). Despite the common belief that cannabis use is generally not combined with alcohol and driving activities, cannabis is the most popular non-alcoholic drug found in the drinking driver group of people. This is consistent to drug abuse statistics in New Zealand [17], international trends [18-20] and the results obtained in Study 2. Compared to cannabis, the sum of all the positive cases for the use of the other drugs was small (4%).

Age and gender parameters

The variables age and gender related to drug and alcohol consumption gave important information on tendencies of the selected portion of the driver population. For example it seems that there are more male drivers (about six times) using drugs as well as alcohol while driving than the equivalent female sample. However consideration must be given to the fact that more male drivers (about 5 times) were tested in comparison to the female sample 4 and that there are about the same amount of male and female licensed drivers in the country 5 [2] (considering that only licensed drivers are allow to drive in New Zealand). This might be due to the fact that blood samples are provided optionally and the random nature of the sampling is affected.
4 5

For different reasons, gender was unknown for 17 drivers Current and limited licence holders (30/04/2006) not including drivers with international licenses [2].

41

Over-representation

of

the

male

sample

might

lead

to

underestimation of the results for the female counterpart (in terms of prevalence). In other words, it is more realistic to state that drug consumption is, to some extent, more prevalent in the male than in the female drink-driving population rather than present figures. Even though there is not an equal number of cases for each age range (comparisons between age groups are not really possible), some assumptions and conclusions can be made: Single drug use The alcohol limit for drivers under 20 years old is 30mg/100mL of blood. 48% (116/241) of the drivers in the earliest age (15-19 years old) tested positive for drugs. A large proportion of drivers consumed cannabis (47%, 114/241), of this figure, 83% (95/114) were male drivers. There was not multiple drug use in this group. A high prevalence of cannabis was found in the group of drivers between 20 and 24 years of age (second youngest group) and the 25 to 34 group, where 23% (150/161) and 28% (188/161) of the total positive cases for cannabis respectively fell. 92% (138/150) of drivers in the first age group were men as well as 86% (162/188) of the second group.

42 The use of methamphetamine or MDMA was evenly spread over drivers aged 20-44 (25% of all positive cases for every subgroup of age). Benzodiazepines were found mainly in the older drivers groups. 31% (11/35) and 34% (12/35) of the drivers with benzodiazepines at 35-44 and 45-64 years old respectively, reflecting possibly that this is the age group more commonly prescribed with this kind of drugs (legitimate use). It is important also to consider the development of tolerance on these drivers.

Multiple drug use Multiple drug use was more prevalent in the 25-34 and the 35-44 years old groups, 6.3% (13/207) and 6% (11/166) of the total number of drivers (positive for drugs) at each age range. Cannabis + methamphetamine combined use was most evident in drivers from 25-44 years old and cannabis + benzodiazepines use arose mainly in the older population. The breakdown of the previous results can be seen in Appendix 4, the general results are summarized in Table 9.

Alcohol levels

To analyse the relationship between alcohol concentrations and drug consumption, the ranges of alcohol concentration were set taking into account the legal limits. Table 10 shows this relationship, Appendix 5 shows the breakdown of positive cases by age and alcohol concentrations, and Figure 4 presents the number of cannabis and alcohol users throughout the different age ranges and alcohol levels. Important observations derived from these results are as follows:

44 Drivers at all levels of alcohol consumption, used cannabis. The most significant figures (Figure 4) were seen at 81160 mg/100 mL (55%, 362/661) and  161 mg/100mL (31%, 203/661). However, it is important to consider that the number of drivers tested for each age range was not the same, which makes comparisons difficult. In the group of 25 to 34 year old drivers, the highest use of cannabis was seen in combination with alcohol levels of 81-160 mg/100mL (23% of the total number of drivers at this age range (107/466) and 16% of the total number of positive cases at this alcohol level). Cannabis use was more prevalent within the male driver population at all alcohol levels (86%, 567/661) in comparison to the female population (13%, 88/661). Six cases fell in the unknown gender category. This fact was most evident at the alcohol level of 81-160 mg/100mL where 89% (324/362) of the positive results for cannabis was found in male drivers. Consideration must be given to the different number of individuals tested for each gender group. Most benzodiazepine use was found at higher levels of alcohol, 60% (21/35) of the total number of drivers with benzodiazepines at  161 mg/100mL. Of this, 76% fell in the age ranges of 35-44 and 45-64 years old. There was no significant difference in the use of

methamphetamines in relation to age ranges.

Driver category / Commercial drivers drivers (information taken from self reported

2.6% (52) of the 2000 samples studied were catalogued as commercial occupations). Two of the 52 commercial drivers were women and neither showed evidence of drug use. 23% (12/52) of male drivers were found to have used drugs. There were no positive results for

46 methamphetamines or morphine but 11 of the drivers tested positive for cannabis. The incidence of drugs in the commercial drivers is lower than in the general sample of male drivers. The number of commercial drivers tested is small and might not represent this population adequately. There was no information on whether these drivers were working when apprehended. Table 11 presents the results in terms of the number of commercial drivers with and without drugs by age. Table 11. Number and percentage of commercial drivers with and without drugs by age category

Study 2

Police officers attending serious car crashes are required to register details of the circumstances related to the event in a standarised form (Police crash report. Appendix 1). In the case of fatal cases (Coroner cases), a post-mortem evaluation is completed by a certified pathologist in order to determine if the cause of the death was natural or due to external factors (the accident itself for example). The information conveyed is then used as evidence in court. Study 2 is intended to determine the proportion of drivers who have died in a car accident and have used drugs and/or alcohol.

Materials
Population

The population studied was deceased drivers involved in single or multiple car crashes (Coroner cases). 4.1.2 Samples

Blood samples from two hundred and forty coronial cases collected over a one year period (July 2004 - June 2005) were analysed. Acceptance criteria for the inclusion of samples in the study are:

50 Specimen: blood (enough volume for drug identification and confirmation / quantitation assays). Sometimes, depending on the conditions of the body, only small volumes of blood are able to be collected. Circumstances: drivers, fatal victims of car crashes on the road (intercity, inner-city and rural roads).

4.2 Methodology
4.2.1 Analytical methodology for alcohol, cannabis, methamphetamine, MDMA,

The blood samples taken from drivers, killed in car crashes were screened morphine and commonly prescribed medicinal drugs that may affect driving ability. One of the screening techniques used to determine the general presence of drugs was ELISA (as described for Study 1, Appendix 3). Unlike Study 1 however, ELISA was only used to screen for methamphetamines, morphine and cannabinoids. Benzodiazepines were analysed by another technique. All positive drug indications from the ELISA screening technique were drugs. Liquid-liquid extraction followed by GC-ECD chromatography was used for the screening and confirmation of a range of benzodiazepines and zopiclone. Liquid-liquid extraction and subsequent GC-MS-NPD chromatography was used for the subsequently submitted to confirmatory analysis to conclusively establish the presence or absence of indicated

51 screening and confirmation of basic and neutral medicinal drugs. A full description of the methodologies applied is given in Appendix 6 and examples of the substances detected in each of them are shown in Table 12. The alcohol determination, as for Study 1, was carried out by GC-FID headspace.

Statistical methodology

The general project, of which this thesis is a part, is intended to analyse 2000 blood samples. It is expected that this number of cases will allow statistically robust inferences to be drawn about the significance of drug use in crashes.

53 Of the 240 samples that were collected and analysed during the research period, only 229 met the requirements for the culpability study and were included in this work. The reason for the exclusion of 11 cases was to avoid possible bias due to: the location of the accident (4 cases did not occur on the road) and drivers who were hospitalised (7 cases of drivers who received different drugs at the hospital). Selection bias was eliminated by including all drivers who died as a consequence of a car accident (the study frame consisted of deceased drivers). General descriptive statistics were performed in relation to: prevalence of drugs, age and gender. Culpable and not culpable groups were analysed in respect to the presence of alcohol alone (alcohol levels), cannabis alone and the combination of alcoholcannabis, time of accident and type of accident (single or multiple). Percentages were calculated from the total number of relevant cases (for every category). An approach to the responsibility analysis of cannabis use on driving impairment was carried out in this study. Cannabis was selected for this analysis due to its high incidence within the New Zealand population and its well known (Chapter 2) complexity in terms of concentration ­ effect relationship, which makes responsibility assessment through conventional methods (driving simulators and controlled driving areas studies) difficult. No power calculation was performed to evaluate the significance of the sample size since there was no background information supporting it (pilot study). However, at this stage in the study, the number of cases analysed is insufficient to enable statistically

54 robust conclusions and so only suggestions of risk and

responsibility associated to drug use are possible. Odds ratio calculations were also done for alcohol and alcoholcannabis. The effect of alcohol on driving skills is well documented [3-6]. However, culpability analysis for other drugs was not possible due to the low number of positive cases at the completion of this thesis. The method used was designed by Drummer et al [7,8] and in this study was applied to New Zealand conditions. The design of such responsibility or culpability analysis is shown below (Table 14) as are some practical examples. Categories and factors used in the assessment of the driver's responsibility are known to be potentially contributory to a crash [9] and were selected on the basis of the information provided by the Police in the Police crash reports. The culpability assessment was conducted without knowledge of the toxicology results. Cross-correlation to the absence or presence of drugs and/or alcohol was completed subsequently. This arrangement is intended to avoid possible bias of the conclusions.

The statistical test applied for the calculation of confidence intervals and p values, was Fisher's exact probability test.

Table 14. Design of the culpability study [7,8]
Crash data analysis The analysis is based on information submitted by the Police including the post-mortem report from the pathologist. Information related to the circumstances of the car crash was extracted from the Police Fatal Crash report (Appendix 1).

Factual data relevant to the culpability assessment was classified in categories: Condition of the road Condition of the vehicle Driving conditions Type of accident Witness observations Road law obedience Difficulty of task involved Level of fatigue Every category was subdivided into factors, that had assigned a rank value depending on how contributory to the accident they are (Appendix 8 [7]) Every relevant factor was scored for each category. The scoring numbers range from 1 to 4, with 1 being not contributory and 4 contributory or mitigating factor for the category. The scores were then added and the result was multiplied by the total number of categories (8) and divided by the number of categories scored. In some cases not enough information was recorded in the Police report to allow scoring for each category. If less than 5 categories were able to be scored, the case was excluded from the analysis in order to prevent bias.

56 Table 14 continued
Culpability or Responsibility analysis A blind analysis in relation to the presence of drugs was performed (unawareness of drug positive cases). Three groups of drivers were established depending on the following range of scores: 8 ­12: Culpable group (fatality due to driver performance) 13 ­ 15: Contributory group (fatality due in part to driving conditions) > 15: Not culpable group (fatality due to factors other than driver performance) Risk evaluation Results from the toxicological analysis and results from the culpability analysis were cross-correlated in order to determine the responsibility of drug use in the causation of the accident. Calculation of the culpability ratio (CR) allows for the risk assessment of car accidents, based on the odds ratio (OR) method of Terhune [7,8,10] (culpable drivers/not culpable drivers, in relation to the presence and absence of drugs). OR > 1: higher risk of car accident, the significance of this association depends on the confidence intervals and p values. The confidence percentage assumed was 95%

57 To illustrate the application of this methodology, some examples are given bellow: Fragments of the report (not originals) have been modified to preserve the confidentiality of the cases, however the information stated is true copy of the original. As in Study 1, identification details of the drivers included in Study 2 remained confidential.

Not culpable case example: Relevant details of the report are shown in Figure 5 and the score calculation in Table 15. Cannabis was detected in the blood sample of the deceased driver at a concentration of 4.6 ng/mL. This is a case of a multiple vehicle crash in which the deceased driver was found not culpable for the accident.

4.3 Discussion and Results
4.3.1 General findings

64 Descriptive statistics of the 229 driver fatalities are shown next and a summary of the results is shown in Table 18. A high proportion of male drivers, compared to the female group (about 3.5 times more) died on the road as a consequence of car crashes. Of the 229 samples analysed, 78% (178) were from male drivers and 22% (51) were taken from female drivers. Over half of the samples analysed, 55 % (125), gave positive results for drugs use (including alcohol) and 45% (104) tested negative. These figures show a high prevalence of drugs and alcohol use within the fatally injured drivers group. The total number of positive drug cases (including alcohol) was 125, 82% (102) of which were male drivers and 18% (23) their female counterparts. This ratio is similar to the gender ratio for all fatally injured drivers. Out of the 178 male, fatally injured drivers, 102 (57%) tested positive for drugs, of which 60 used single drugs and 42 consumed multiple drugs. Of the fatally injured drivers aged 20-44, more had used drugs than had not. For the under 20 and over 45 year age groups drug use was less common (Table 19). Of the 51 female fatally injured drivers, 23 (45%) tested positive for drugs. Similar figures were found for single and multiple drug consumption: 11 (48%) used single drugs and 12 (52%) a combination of drugs.

65 Single drug use Of the 71 drivers who had used a single drug, alcohol was the most common drug being found in 45% (32) of the deceased drivers. A similar proportion of the male and female drivers had consumed alcohol. Cannabis was the second most commonly detected drug being found in 38% (27) of the 71 drivers. Cannabis use was more prevalent in male drivers (93%, 25 drivers) than in female drivers (7%, 2 drivers). Interestingly, methamphetamine was not detected in this group.

Multiple drug use The combination cannabis-alcohol was highly prevalent within the population analysed with 63% (34) of the 54 cases. Also important was the wide range of drug combinations that included legal and illegal substances. There was no information as to whether the legal drugs or medicines were prescribed or used for recreational purposes. A breakdown of the results by age and gender is shown in Appendix 9, general results are listed in Table 19 and the main findings are:

66 Twenty six percent (33) of the 125 total positive cases fell in the group of drivers aged 25-34 years old. The incidence of drug use was significantly higher in this range of age (26/102 male and 7/23 female) with only 7 drivers not using drugs. When alcohol or cannabis was used alone, it was equally distributed over drivers aged 15 ­ 64, oscillating between 12 and 25% for alcohol and 15 and 22% for cannabis (Appendix 9). Single usage of other drugs, such as paroxetine or fluoxetine was seen in the oldest group of drivers (4565+). It is very possible that they were medically prescribed. Benzodiazepines use was observed in drivers aged 25-44 years old. The combination alcohol ­ cannabis was mainly seen within drivers in the range of 25-34 (35%, 12 cases) and 35-44 years old (29%, 10 cases), in a lower proportion for drivers in the age of 15-24 years old (32%, 11 cases) and almost non-existent for drivers older than 45 years old (3%, 1 case). Another important combination was cannabis + alcohol + methamphetamine, found in the range of 25-34 years old for female drivers (2 drivers each aged 31 years old), and 20-44 in the case of male drivers (1 driver aged 23 and 1 driver 40 years old).

Other statistical information related to the type of crash (multiple or single) and the time of the accident, in the presence or absence of alcohol, cannabis and the combination alcoholcannabis was extracted from this study and is summarized in Appendix 10. The general results are shown below: Most of the accidents, where alcohol was involved, were single vehicle that often occurred against immobile objects (72%, 23 cases). A high number of these accidents took place in the early hours of the morning (37%, 12 cases between 12.01 and 6.00 am). In the cases where cannabis alone had been used, 67% (18) of the cases were multiple car crashes. These crashes occurred all through the day but more commonly during daylight hours, from 6.00 am to 6.00 pm (37%, 18 cases).

69 Drivers who used the combination cannabis ­ alcohol had a similar occurrence of single and multiple car accidents, 41% (14) for multiple and 59% (20) for single crashes. Most of these accidents happen between 6.00 pm and 6.00 am (79%, 27 cases). 75% (78) of drivers with no evidence of drugs in their blood were involved in multiple car crashes. These collisions occurred all through the day with a slightly higher tendency (as for cannabis) at night time from 6.00 am to 6.00 p.m.

The results for the calculation of culpability ratios and odds ratios for cannabis, alcohol and their combination, as well as the confidence intervals and their p values are shown in Table 22. It was possible to assess the risk associated with different blood alcohol concentrations. However, there were not enough samples to do so for different blood THC levels in the cases of cannabis use.

Risk and Responsibility Drivers who had a car accident after consuming alcohol (all levels) were 2.6 times more likely to be culpable, compared to the group of people driving without drugs. The risk is almost doubled when the intake of alcohol is higher than 161 mg/100 mL (OR: 4.2).

71

The use of cannabis alone does not seem to increase the risk of a car accident (OR: 0.98), it rather appears to be the same as for the negative drug use group (OR: 1.0). The use of alcohol combined with cannabis quadruples the risk of being culpable for a car crash. This result is consistent with previous studies that have shown important driving impairment caused by this combination and elevated crash risk rates [4,5,11,12].

Significance Only the odd ratio for the concomitant use of cannabis and alcohol had a p value of less than 0.05 at which associations are considered statistically robust (Table 22). The odd ratio for the alcohol category (total use) showed some statistical meaning but not enough to reach the conventional value for significance (p< 0.05). Except in the case of the cannabis-alcohol category, the small sample size used for comparisons reflects lack of statistical significance (too small to represent the population and to give fair statistical significance). Therefore a larger statistical sample (like the 2000 samples originally set for Study 2) will reveal a better picture of the risk and responsibility of drug use prior driving.

Conclusions

Cannabis is without doubts, the most used recreational drug, after alcohol in the driver population of New Zealand. This tendency is reflected worldwide as different statistics and studies show use of this drug to be widespread within the general and the driver populations. Cannabis is also the most used drug in combination with alcohol within the drinking driver population of New Zealand. The concomitant use of cannabis with alcohol has a higher incidence of use within the fatally injured drivers, in comparison to each substance alone and other drug combinations. High use of alcohol and drugs, especially cannabis, is evident in the youngest age group of drivers (uninjured drivers from fifteen to thirty four years old). More male drivers die as a consequence of car crashes in New Zealand than female drivers. Likewise, cannabis use is more prevalent in the male (injured and uninjured) driver population. At the moment, methamphetamine and MDMA use does not seem to be as significant, in terms of incidence within

76 the driver population, as cannabis, alcohol, cannabis and alcohol combined and benzodiazepines use. Usage of other drugs (including morphine and heroin) individually or in combination does not seem to be substantial. However the wide range of combinations, including legal and illegal drugs, is important to be considered as represents a complex and dangerous menace on the roads. Accidents involving alcohol seem to occur in a higher percentage as single car accidents in the early hours of the morning (from midnight to 6.00 am). The culpability analysis approach shows an increased risk of accidents when alcohol (2.6 times) or the combination alcohol-cannabis (4.2 times) is present. However, only results for the latter (alcohol-cannabis) have statistical significance (p < 0.05). Cannabis use does not seem to increase the risk or car crash occurrence, as the odds ratio for the group of drivers who tested positive for the drug, is similar to the free-drug group's ratio. The lack of statistical significance for most of the results of the culpability analysis, indicates the need for a larger and more representative sample from the fatally injured driver group.

77

5.1 Suggestions
A larger sample should be analysed to enable solid conclusions regarding the culpability or responsibility of drivers under the influence of drugs. The completion of Study 2 as part of the general project: "Drinking and drugged driver control: delineating the problem" will most probably allow for such reliable conclusions to be reached. The inclusion of the seriously injured driver population into this project or a similar one, will broaden the current knowledge on drugs incidence and effects on driving performance.
