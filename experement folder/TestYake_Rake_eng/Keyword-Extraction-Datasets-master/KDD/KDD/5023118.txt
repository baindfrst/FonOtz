Truth discovery with multiple conflicting information providers on the web The world-wide web has become the most important information source for most of us . Unfortunately , there is no guarantee for the correctness of information on the web . Moreover , different web sites often provide conflicting information on a subject , such as different specifications for the same product . In this paper we propose a new problem called Veracity , i.e. , conformity to truth , which studies how to find true facts from a large amount of conflicting information on many subjects that is provided by various web sites . We design a general framework for the Veracity problem , and invent an algorithm called TruthFinder , which utilizes the relationships between web sites and their information , i.e. , a web site is trustworthy if it provides many pieces of true information , and a piece of information is likely to be true if it is provided by many trustworthy web sites . Our experiments show that TruthFinder successfully finds true facts among conflicting information , and identifies trustworthy web sites better than the popular search engines .
